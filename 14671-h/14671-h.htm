<h2><a name="A_TOUCH_OF_BLACK_MAGIC" id=
"A_TOUCH_OF_BLACK_MAGIC"></a> <a name="Page_1" id="Page_1"></a>A
TOUCH OF BLACK MAGIC</h2>
<p>I draw the wizard's circle upon the sands, and blue flames
spring from its circumference. I describe an inner circle, and
green flames come responsive to my words of magic. I touch the
common centre of both with my wand, and red flames, like adders'
tongues, leap from the earth. Over these flames I place my caldron
filled with the blood of a new-killed doe, and as it boils I speak
my incantations and make my mystic signs and passes, watching the
blood-red mist as it rises to meet the spirits of Air. I chant my
conjurations as I learned them from the Great Key of Solomon, and
while I speak, the ruddy fumes take human forms. Out of the dark,
fathomless Past&mdash;the Past of near four hundred years
ago&mdash;comes a goodly company of simple, pompous folk all having
a touch of childish savagery which shows itself in the fierceness
of their love and of their hate.</p>
<p>The fairest castle-ch&acirc;teau in all England's great domain,
the walls and halls of which were builded in the depths of time,
takes on again its olden form quick with quivering life, and from
the gates of Eagle Tower issues my quaint and radiant company. Some
are clad in gold lace, silks, and taffetas; some wear leather,
buckram and clanking steel. While the caldron boils, their
cloud-forms grow ever more distinct and definite, till at length I
can trace their every feature. I see the color of their eyes. I
discern the shades of their hair. Some heads are streaked with
gray; others are glossy with the sheen of youth.<a name="Page_2"
id="Page_2"></a> As a climax to my conjurations I speak the word of
all words magical, "Dorothy," and lo! as though God had said, "Let
there be light," a fair, radiant girl steps from the portals of
Haddon Hall and illumines all my ancient company so that I may see
even the workings of their hearts.</p>
<p>They, and the events of their lives, their joys and sorrows,
their virtues and sins, their hatreds, jealousies, and
loves&mdash;the seven numbers in the total sum of life&mdash;pass
before me as in a panorama, moving when I bid them move, pausing
when I bid them pause, speaking when I bid them speak, and alas!
fading back into the dim gray limbo of the past long, long ere I
would have them go.</p>
<p>But hark! my radiant shades are about to speak. The play is
about to begin.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2>I RIDE DOWN TO HADDON</h2>
<p>Since I play no mean part in the events of this chronicle, a few
words concerning my own history previous to the opening of the
story I am about to tell you will surely not be amiss, and they may
help you to a better understanding of my narrative.</p>
<p>To begin with an unimportant fact&mdash;unimportant, that is, to
you&mdash;my name is Malcolm Fran&ccedil;ois de Lorraine Vernon. My
father was cousin-german to Sir George Vernon, at and near whose
home, Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, occurred the events which will
furnish my theme.</p>
<p>Of the ancient lineage of the house of Vernon I need not speak.
You already know that the family is one of the oldest in England,
and while it is not of the highest nobility, it is quite gentle and
noble enough to please those who bear its honored name. My mother
boasted nobler blood than that of the Vernons. She was of the
princely French house of Guise&mdash;a niece and ward to the Great
Duke, for whose sake I was named.</p>
<p>My father, being a younger brother, sought adventure in the land
of France, where his handsome person and engaging manner won the
smiles of Dame Fortune and my mother at one and the same cast. In
due time I was born, and upon the day following that great event my
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>father died. On the day of his
burial my poor mother, unable to find in me either compensation or
consolation for the loss of her child's father, also died, of a
broken heart, it was said. But God was right, as usual, in taking
my parents; for I should have brought them no happiness, unless
perchance they could have moulded my life to a better form than it
has had&mdash;a doubtful chance, since our great virtues and our
chief faults are born and die with us. My faults, alas! have been
many and great. In my youth I knew but one virtue: to love my
friend; and that was strong within me. How fortunate for us it
would be if we could begin our life in wisdom and end it in
simplicity, instead of the reverse which now obtains!</p>
<p>I remained with my granduncle, the Great Duke, and was brought
up amid the fighting, vice, and piety of his sumptuous court. I was
trained to arms, and at an early age became Esquire in Waiting to
his Grace of Guise. Most of my days between my fifteenth and
twenty-fifth years were spent in the wars. At the age of
twenty-five I returned to the ch&acirc;teau, there to reside as my
uncle's representative, and to endure the ennui of peace. At the
ch&acirc;teau I found a fair, tall girl, fifteen years of age: Mary
Stuart, Queen of Scotland, soon afterward Queen of France and
rightful heiress to the English throne. The ennui of peace, did I
say? Soon I had no fear of its depressing effect, for Mary Stuart
was one of those women near whose fascinations peace does not
thrive. When I found her at the ch&acirc;teau, my martial ardor
lost its warmth. Another sort of flame took up its home in my
heart, and no power could have turned me to the wars again.</p>
<p>Ah! what a gay, delightful life, tinctured with bitterness, we
led in the grand old ch&acirc;teau, and looking back at it how
heartless, godless, and empty it seems. Do not from these words
conclude that I am a fanatic, nor that I shall pour into your ears
a ranter's tale; for cant is more to be despised <a name="Page_5"
id="Page_5"></a>even than godlessness; but during the period of my
life of which I shall write I learned&mdash;but what I learned I
shall in due time tell you.</p>
<p>While at the court of Guise I, like many another man, conceived
for Mary Stuart a passion which lay heavy upon my heart for many
years. Sweethearts I had by the scores, but she held my longings
from all of them until I felt the touch of a pure woman's love, and
then&mdash;but again I am going beyond my story.</p>
<p>I did not doubt, nor do I hesitate to say, that my passion was
returned by Mary with a fervor which she felt for no other lover;
but she was a queen, and I, compared with her, was nobody. For this
difference of rank I have since had good cause to be thankful.
Great beauty is diffusive in its tendency. Like the sun, it cannot
shine for one alone. Still, it burns and dazzles the one as if it
shone for him and for no other; and he who basks in its rays need
have no fear of the ennui of peace.</p>
<p>The time came when I tasted the unutterable bitterness of Mary's
marriage to a simpering fool, Francis II., whom she loathed,
notwithstanding absurd stories of their sweet courtship and
love.</p>
<p>After her marriage to Francis, Mary became hard and callous of
heart, and all the world knows her sad history. The stories of
Darnley, Rizzio, and Bothwell will be rich morsels, I suppose, for
the morbid minds of men and women so long as books are read and
scandal is loved.</p>
<p>Ah, well, that was long ago; so long ago that now as I write it
seems but a shadow upon the horizon of time.</p>
<p>And so it happened that Francis died, and when the queen went
back to Scotland to ascend her native throne, I went with her, and
mothlike hovered near the blaze that burned but did not warm
me.</p>
<p>Then in the course of time came the Darnley tragedy. I saw
Rizzio killed. Gods! what a scene for hell was that!<a name=
"Page_6" id="Page_6"></a> Then followed the Bothwell disgrace, the
queen's imprisonment at Lochleven, and my own flight from Scotland
to save my head.</p>
<p>You will hear of Mary again in this history, and still clinging
to her you will find that same strange fatality which during all
her life brought evils upon her that were infectious to her friends
and wrought their ruin.</p>
<p>One evening, in the autumn of the year 1567, I was sitting
moodily before my fire in the town of Dundee, brooding over Mary's
disgraceful liaison with Bothwell. I had solemnly resolved that I
would see her never again, and that I would turn my back upon the
evil life I had led for so many years, and would seek to acquire
that quiescence of nature which is necessary to an endurable old
age. A tumultuous soul in the breast of an old man breeds torture,
but age, with the heart at rest, I have found is the best season of
life.</p>
<p>In the midst of my gloomy thoughts and good resolves my friend,
Sir Thomas Douglas, entered my room without warning and in great
agitation.</p>
<p>"Are you alone?" he asked hurriedly, in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Save for your welcome presence, Sir Thomas," I answered,
offering my hand.</p>
<p>"The queen has been seized," he whispered, "and warrants for
high treason have been issued against many of her friends&mdash;you
among the number. Officers are now coming to serve the writ. I rode
hither in all haste to warn you. Lose not a moment, but flee for
your life. The Earl of Murray will be made regent to-morrow."</p>
<p>"My servant? My horse?" I responded.</p>
<p>"Do not wait. Go at once. I shall try to send a horse for you to
Craig's ferry. If I fail, cross the firth without one. Here is a
purse. The queen sends it to you. Go! Go!"</p>
<p>I acted upon the advice, of Sir Thomas and hurried into the
street, snatching up my hat, cloak, and sword as I <a name="Page_7"
id="Page_7"></a>went. Night had fallen, and darkness and rain,
which at first I was inclined to curse, proved to be my friends. I
sought the back streets and alleys and walked rapidly toward the
west gates of the city. Upon arriving at the gates I found them
closed. I aroused the warden, and with the artful argument of gold
had almost persuaded him to let me pass. My evident eagerness was
my undoing, for in the hope of obtaining more gold the warden
delayed opening the gates till two men approached on horseback,
and, dismounting, demanded my surrender.</p>
<p>I laughed and said: "Two against one! Gentlemen, I am caught." I
then drew my sword as if to offer it to them. My action threw the
men off their guard, and when I said, "Here it is," I gave it to
the one standing near me, but I gave it to him point first and in
the heart.</p>
<p>It was a terrible thing to do, and bordered so closely on a
broken parole that I was troubled in conscience. I had not,
however, given my parole, nor had I surrendered; and if I had done
so&mdash;if a man may take another's life in self-defence, may he
not lie to save himself?</p>
<p>The other man shot at me with his fusil, but missed. He then
drew his sword; but he was no match for me, and soon I left him
sprawling on the ground, dead or alive, I knew not which.</p>
<p>At the time of which I write I was thirty-five years of age, and
since my fifteenth birthday my occupations had been arms and the
ladies&mdash;two arts requiring constant use if one would remain
expert in their practice.</p>
<p>I escaped, and ran along the wall to a deep breach which had
been left unrepaired. Over the sharp rocks I clambered, and at the
risk of breaking my neck I jumped off the wall into the moat, which
was almost dry. Dawn was breaking when I found a place to ascend
from the moat, and I hastened to the fields and forests, where all
day and all night long I wandered without food or drink. Two
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>hours before sunrise next morning
I reached Craig's Ferry. The horse sent by Douglas awaited me, but
the ferry-master had been prohibited from carrying passengers
across the firth, and I could not take the horse in a small boat.
In truth, I was in great alarm lest I should be unable to cross,
but I walked up the Tay a short distance, and found a fisherman,
who agreed to take me over in his frail craft. Hardly had we
started when another boat put out from shore in pursuit of us. We
made all sail, but our pursuers overtook us when we were within
half a furlong of the south bank, and as there were four men in the
other boat, all armed with fusils, I peaceably stepped into their
craft and handed my sword to their captain.</p>
<p>I seated myself on one of the thwarts well forward in the boat.
By my side was a heavy iron boat-hook. I had noticed that all the
occupants of the boat, except the fisherman who sailed her, wore
armor; and when I saw the boat-hook, a diabolical thought entered
my mind and I immediately acted upon its suggestion. Noiselessly I
grasped the hook, and with its point pried loose a board in the
bottom of the boat, first having removed my boots, cloak, and
doublet. When the board was loosened I pressed my heel against it
with all the force I could muster, and through an opening six
inches broad and four feet long came a flood of water that swamped
the boat before one could utter twenty words. I heard a cry from
one of the men: "The dog has scuttled the boat. Shoot him!" At the
same instant the blaze and noise of two fusils broke the still
blackness of the night, but I was overboard and the powder and lead
were wasted. The next moment the boat sank in ten fathoms of water,
and with it went the men in armor. I hope the fisherman saved
himself. I have often wondered if even the law of self-preservation
justified my act. It is an awful thing to inflict death, but it is
worse to endure it, and I feel sure that I am foolish <a name=
"Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>to allow my conscience to trouble me for
the sake of those who would have led me back to the scaffold.</p>
<p>I fear you will think that six dead men in less than as many
pages make a record of bloodshed giving promise of terrible things
to come, but I am glad I can reassure you on that point. Although
there may be some good fighting ahead of us, I believe the last man
has been killed of whom I shall chronicle&mdash;the last, that is,
in fight or battle.</p>
<p>In truth, the history which you are about to read is not my own.
It is the story of a beautiful, wilful girl, who was madly in love
with the one man in all the world whom she should have
avoided&mdash;as girls are wont to be. This perverse tendency,
philosophers tell us, is owing to the fact that the unattainable is
strangely alluring to womankind. I, being a man, shall not, of
course, dwell upon the foibles of my own sex. It were a foolish
candor.</p>
<p>As I said, there will be some good fighting ahead of us, for
love and battle usually go together. One must have warm, rich blood
to do either well; and, save religion, there is no source more
fruitful of quarrels and death than that passion which is the
source of life.</p>
<p>You, of course, know without the telling, that I reached land
safely after I scuttled the boat, else I should not be writing this
forty years afterwards.</p>
<p>The sun had risen when I waded ashore. I was swordless,
coatless, hatless, and bootless; but I carried a well-filled purse
in my belt. Up to that time I had given no thought to my ultimate
destination; but being for the moment safe, I pondered the question
and determined to make my way to Haddon Hall in Derbyshire, where I
was sure a warm welcome would await me from my cousin, Sir George
Vernon. How I found a peasant's cottage, purchased a poor horse and
a few coarse garments, and how in the disguise of a peasant I rode
southward to <a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>the English border,
avoiding the cities and the main highways, might interest you; but
I am eager to come to my story, and I will not tell you of my
perilous journey.</p>
<p>One frosty morning, after many hairbreadth escapes, I found
myself well within the English border, and turned my horse's head
toward the city of Carlisle. There I purchased a fine charger. I
bought clothing fit for a gentleman, a new sword, a hand-fusil, a
breastplate, and a steel-lined cap, and feeling once again like a
man rather than like a half-drowned rat, I turned southward for
Derbyshire and Haddon Hall.</p>
<p>When I left Scotland I had no fear of meeting danger in England;
but at Carlisle I learned that Elizabeth held no favor toward
Scottish refugees. I also learned that the direct road from
Carlisle to Haddon, by way of Buxton, was infested with English
spies who were on the watch for friends of the deposed Scottish
queen. Several Scotchmen had been arrested, and it was the general
opinion that upon one pretext or another they would be hanged. I
therefore chose a circuitous road leading to the town of Derby,
which lay south of Haddon at a distance of six or seven leagues. It
would be safer for me to arrive at Haddon travelling from the south
than from the north. Thus, after many days, I rode into Derby-town
and stabled my horse at the Royal Arms.</p>
<p>I called for supper, and while I was waiting for my joint of
beef a stranger entered the room and gave his orders in a free,
offhand manner that stamped him a person of quality.</p>
<p>The night outside was cold. While the stranger and I sat before
the fire we caught its infectious warmth, and when he showed a
disposition to talk, I gladly fell in with his humor. Soon we were
filling our glasses from the same bowl of punch, and we seemed to
be on good terms with each other. But when God breathed into the
human <a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>body a part of himself, by
some mischance He permitted the devil to slip into the tongue and
loosen it. My tongue, which ordinarily was fairly well behaved,
upon this occasion quickly brought me into trouble.</p>
<p>I told you that the stranger and I seemed to be upon good terms.
And so we were until I, forgetting for the moment Elizabeth's
hatred of Mary's friends, and hoping to learn the stranger's name
and quality, said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My name is Vernon&mdash;Sir Malcolm Vernon, knight by the hand
of Queen Mary of Scotland and of France." This remark, of course,
required that my companion should in return make known his name and
degree; but in place of so doing he at once drew away from me and
sat in silence. I was older than he, and it had seemed to me quite
proper and right that I should make the first advance. But
instantly after I had spoken I regretted my words. I remembered not
only my danger, being a Scottish refugee, but I also bethought me
that I had betrayed myself. Aside from those causes of uneasiness,
the stranger's conduct was an insult which I was in duty bound not
to overlook. Neither was I inclined to do so, for I loved to fight.
In truth, I loved all things evil.</p>
<p>"I regret, sir," said I, after a moment or two of embarrassing
silence, "having imparted information that seems to annoy you. The
Vernons, whom you may not know, are your equals in blood, it
matters not who you are."</p>
<p>"I know of the Vernons," he replied coldly, "and I well know
that they are of good blood and lineage. As for wealth, I am told
Sir George could easily buy the estates of any six men in
Derbyshire."</p>
<p>"You know Sir George?" I asked despite myself.</p>
<p>"I do not know him, I am glad to say," returned the
stranger.</p>
<p>"By God, sir, you shall answer-"</p>
<p>"At your pleasure, Sir Malcolm."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>My pleasure is now," I
retorted eagerly.</p>
<p>I threw off my doublet and pushed the table and chairs against
the wall to make room for the fight; but the stranger, who had not
drawn his sword, said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have eaten nothing since morning, and I am as hungry as a
wolf. I would prefer to fight after supper; but if you
insist&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I do insist," I replied. "Perhaps you will not care for supper
when I have&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That may be true," he interrupted; "but before we begin I think
it right to tell you, without at all meaning to boast of my skill,
that I can kill you if I wish to do so. Therefore you must see that
the result of our fight will be disagreeable to you in any case.
You will die, or you will owe me your life."</p>
<p>His cool impertinence angered me beyond endurance. He to speak
of killing me, one of the best swordsmen in France, where the art
of sword-play is really an art! The English are but bunglers with a
gentleman's blade, and should restrict themselves to pike and
quarterstaff.</p>
<p>"Results be damned!" I answered. "I can kill you if I wish."
Then it occurred to me that I really did not wish to kill the
handsome young fellow toward whom I felt an irresistible
attraction.</p>
<p>I continued: "But I prefer that you should owe me your life. I
do not wish to kill you. Guard!"</p>
<p>My opponent did not lift his sword, but smilingly
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Then why do you insist upon fighting? I certainly do not wish
to kill you. In truth, I would be inclined to like you if you were
not a Vernon."</p>
<p>"Damn your insolence! Guard! or I will run you through where you
stand," I answered angrily.</p>
<p>"But why do we fight?" insisted the stubborn fellow, with a
coolness that showed he was not one whit in fear of me.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>You should know," I replied,
dropping my sword-point to the floor, and forgetting for the moment
the cause of our quarrel. "I&mdash;I do not."</p>
<p>"Then let us not fight," he answered, "until we have discovered
the matter of our disagreement."</p>
<p>At this remark neither of us could resist smiling. I had not
fought since months before, save for a moment at the gates of
Dundee, and I was loath to miss the opportunity, so I remained in
thought during the space of half a minute and remembered our cause
of war.</p>
<p>"Oh! I recall the reason for our fighting," I replied, "and a
good one it was. You offered affront to the name of Sir George
Vernon, and insultingly refused me the courtesy of your name after
I had done you the honor to tell you mine."</p>
<p>"I did not tell you my name," replied the stranger, "because I
believed you would not care to hear it; and I said I was glad not
to know Sir George Vernon because&mdash;because he is my father's
enemy. I am Sir John Manners. My father is Lord Rutland."</p>
<p>Then it was my turn to recede. "You certainly are right. I do
not care to hear your name."</p>
<p>I put my sword in its scabbard and drew the table back to its
former place. Sir John stood in hesitation for a moment or two, and
then said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sir Malcolm, may we not declare a truce for to-night? There is
nothing personal in the enmity between us."</p>
<p>"Nothing," I answered, staring at the fire, half regretful that
we bore each other enmity at all.</p>
<p>"You hate me, or believe you do," said Manners, "because your
father's cousin hates my father; and I try to make myself believe
that I hate you because my father hates your father's cousin. Are
we not both mistaken?"</p>
<p>I was quick to anger and to fight, but no man's heart <a name=
"Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>was more sensitive than mine to the fair
touch of a kind word.</p>
<p>"I am not mistaken, Sir John, when I say that I do not hate
you," I answered.</p>
<p>"Nor do I hate you, Sir Malcolm. Will you give me your
hand?"</p>
<p>"Gladly," I responded, and I offered my hand to the enemy of my
house.</p>
<p>"Landlord," I cried, "bring us two bottles of your best sack.
The best in the house, mind you."</p>
<p>After our amicable understanding, Sir John and myself were very
comfortable together, and when the sack and roast beef, for which
the Royal Arms was justly famous, were brought in, we sat down to
an enjoyable meal.</p>
<p>After supper Sir John lighted a small roll or stick made from
the leaves of tobacco. The stick was called a cigarro, and I, proud
not to be behind him in new-fashioned, gentlemanly accomplishments,
called to the landlord for a pipe. Manners interrupted me when I
gave the order and offered me a cigarro which I gladly
accepted.</p>
<p>Despite my effort to reassure myself, I could not quite throw
off a feeling of uneasiness whenever I thought of the manner in
which I had betrayed to Sir John the fact that I was a friend to
Mary Stuart. I knew that treachery was not native to English blood,
and my knowledge of mankind had told me that the vice could not
live in Sir John Manners's heart. But he had told me of his
residence at the court of Elizabeth, and I feared trouble might
come to me from the possession of so dangerous a piece of knowledge
by an enemy of my house.</p>
<p>I did not speak my thoughts upon the matter, and we sat the
evening through discussing many subjects. We warmed toward each
other and became quite confidential. I feel ashamed when I admit
that one of my many sins was an excessive indulgence in wine. While
I was not a <a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>drunkard, I was
given to my cups sometimes in a degree both dangerous and
disgraceful; and during the evening of which I have just spoken I
talked to Sir John with a freedom that afterward made me blush,
although my indiscretion brought me no greater trouble.</p>
<p>My outburst of confidence was prompted by Sir John's voluntary
assurance that I need fear nothing from having told him that I was
a friend of Queen Mary. The Scottish queen's name had been
mentioned, and Sir John had said&mdash;</p>
<p>"I take it, Sir Malcolm, that you are newly arrived in England,
and I feel sure you will accept the advice I am about to offer in
the kindly spirit in which it is meant. I deem it unsafe for you to
speak of Queen Mary's friendship in the open manner you have used
toward me. Her friends are not welcome visitors to England, and I
fear evil will befall those who come to us as refugees. You need
have no fear that I will betray you. Your secret is safe with me. I
will give you hostage. I also am Queen Mary's friend. I would not,
of course, favor her against the interest of our own queen. To
Elizabeth I am and always shall be loyal; but the unfortunate
Scottish queen has my sympathy in her troubles, and I should be
glad to help her. I hear she is most beautiful and gentle in
person."</p>
<p>Thus you see the influence of Mary's beauty reached from
Edinburgh to London. A few months only were to pass till this
conversation was to be recalled by each of us, and the baneful
influence of Mary's beauty upon all whom it touched was to be shown
more fatally than had appeared even in my own case. In truth, my
reason for speaking so fully concerning the, Scottish queen and
myself will be apparent to you in good time.</p>
<p>When we were about to part for the night, I asked Sir John,
"What road do you travel to-morrow?"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>I am going to Rutland Castle
by way of Rowsley," he answered.</p>
<p>"I, too, travel by Rowsley to Haddon Hall. Shall we not extend
our truce over the morrow and ride together as far as Rowsley?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"I shall be glad to make the truce perpetual," he replied
laughingly.</p>
<p>"So shall I," was my response.</p>
<p>Thus we sealed our compact and knitted out of the warp and woof
of enmity a friendship which became a great joy and a sweet grief
to each of us.</p>
<p>That night I lay for hours thinking of the past and wondering
about the future. I had tasted the sweets&mdash;all flavored with
bitterness&mdash;of court life. Women, wine, gambling, and fighting
had given me the best of all the evils they had to offer. Was I now
to drop that valorous life, which men so ardently seek, and was I
to take up a browsing, kinelike existence at Haddon Hall, there to
drone away my remaining days in fat'ning, peace, and quietude? I
could not answer my own question, but this I knew: that Sir George
Vernon was held in high esteem by Elizabeth, and I felt that his
house was, perhaps, the only spot in England where my head could
safely lie. I also had other plans concerning Sir George and his
household which I regret to say I imparted to Sir John in the
sack-prompted outpouring of my confidence. The plans of which I
shall now speak had been growing in favor with me for several
months previous to my enforced departure from Scotland, and that
event had almost determined me to adopt them. Almost, I say, for
when I approached Haddon Hall I wavered in my resolution.</p>
<p>At the time when I had last visited Sir George at Haddon, his
daughter Dorothy&mdash;Sir George called her Doll&mdash;was a
slipshod girl of twelve. She was exceedingly plain, and gave
promise of always so remaining. Sir George, <a name="Page_17" id=
"Page_17"></a>who had no son, was anxious that his vast estates
should remain in the Vernon name. He had upon the occasion of my
last visit intimated to me that when Doll should become old enough
to marry, and I, perchance, had had my fill of knocking about the
world, a marriage might be brought about between us which would
enable him to leave his estates to his daughter and still to retain
the much-loved Vernon name for his descendants.</p>
<p>Owing to Doll's rusty red hair, slim shanks, and freckled face,
the proposition had not struck me with favor, yet to please Sir
George I had feigned acquiescence, and had said that when the time
should come, we would talk it over. Before my flight from Scotland
I had often thought of Sir George's proposition made six or seven
years before. My love for Mary Stuart had dimmed the light of other
beauties in my eyes, and I had never married. For many months
before my flight, however, I had not been permitted to bask in the
light of Mary's smiles to the extent of my wishes. Younger men,
among them Darnley, who was but eighteen years of age, were
preferred to me, and I had begun to consider the advisability of an
orderly retreat from the Scottish court before my lustre should be
entirely dimmed. It is said that a man is young so long as he is
strong, and I was strong as in the days of my youth. My cheeks were
fresh, my eyes were bright, and my hair was red as when I was
twenty, and without a thread of gray. Stills my temperament was
more exacting and serious, and the thought of becoming settled for
life, or rather for old age and death, was growing in favor with
me. With that thought came always a suggestion of slim, freckled
Dorothy and Sir George's offer. She held out to me wealth and
position, a peaceful home for my old age, and a grave with a
pompous, pious epitaph at Bakewell church, in death.</p>
<p>When I was compelled to leave Scotland, circumstances <a name=
"Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>forced me to a decision, and my
resolution was quickly taken. I would go to Derbyshire and would
marry Dorothy. I did not expect ever again to feel great love for a
woman. The fuse, I thought, had burned out when I loved Mary
Stuart. One woman, I believed, was like another to me, and Dorothy
would answer as well as any for my wife. I could and would be kind
to her, and that alone in time would make me fond. It is true, my
affection would be of a fashion more comfortable than exciting; but
who, having passed his galloping youth, will contemn the joys that
come from making others happy? I believe there is no person, past
the age of forty, at all given to pondering the whys of life, who
will gainsay that the joy we give to others is our chief source of
happiness. Why, then, should not a wise man, through purely selfish
motives, begin early to cultivate the gentle art of giving joy?</p>
<p>But the fates were to work out the destinies of Dorothy and
myself without our assistance. Self-willed, arrogant creatures are
those same fates, but they save us a deal of trouble by assuming
our responsibilities.</p>

"Page_19"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2>THE IRON, THE SEED, THE CLOUD, AND THE RAIN</h2>
<p>The morning following my meeting with Manners, he and I made an
early start. An hour before noon we rode into the town of Rowsley
and halted at The Peacock for dinner.</p>
<p>When we entered the courtyard of the inn we saw three ladies
warmly wrapped in rich furs leave a ponderous coach and walk to the
inn door, which they entered. One of them was an elderly lady whom
I recognized as my cousin, Lady Dorothy Crawford, sister to Sir
George Vernon. The second was a tall, beautiful girl, with an
exquisite ivory-like complexion and a wonderful crown of fluffy red
hair which encircled her head like a halo of sunlit glory. I could
compare its wondrous lustre to no color save that of molten gold
deeply alloyed with copper. But that comparison tells you nothing.
I can find no simile with which to describe the beauties of its
shades and tints. It was red, but it also was golden, as if the
enamoured sun had gilded every hair with its radiance. In all my
life I had never seen anything so beautiful as this tall girl's
hair. Still, it was the Vernon red. My cousin, Sir George, and many
Vernons had hair of the same color. Yet the girl's hair differed
from all other I had ever seen. It had a light and a lustre of its
own which was as distinct from the ordinary Vernon red, although
that is very good and we are proud of it, as the sheen of gold is
from <a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>the glitter of brass. I
knew by the girl's hair that she was my cousin, Dorothy Vernon,
whom I reluctantly had come to wed.</p>
<p>I asked myself, "Can this be the plain, freckled girl I knew
seven years ago?" Compared with her beauty even Mary Stuart's was
pale as the vapid moon at dawn. The girl seemed to be the
incarnated spirit of universal life and light, and I had
condescendingly come to marry this goddess. I felt a dash of
contemptuous pity for my complacent self.</p>
<p>In my cogitations concerning marriage with Dorothy Vernon, I had
not at all taken into consideration her personal inclination. A
girl, after all, is but the chattel of her father, and must,
perforce, if needs be, marry the man who is chosen for her. But
leaving parental authority out of the question, a girl with
brick-red hair and a multitude of freckles need not be considered
when an agreeable, handsome man offers himself as a husband. She
usually is willing to the point of eagerness. That is the manner in
which I had thought about Dorothy Vernon, if I considered her at
all. But when a man is about to offer himself to a goddess, he is
apt to pause. In such a case there are always two sides to the
question, and nine chances to one the goddess will coolly take
possession of both. When I saw Dorothy in the courtyard of The
Peacock, I instantly knew that she was a girl to be taken into
account in all matters wherein she was personally concerned. Her
every feature, every poise and gesture, unconsciously bore the
stamp of "I will" or "I will not."</p>
<p>Walking by Dorothy's side, holding her hand, was a fair young
woman whose hair was black, and whose skin was of the white, clear
complexion such as we see in the faces of nuns. She walked with a
hesitating, cautious step, and clung to Dorothy, who was gentle and
attentive to her.<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a> But of this
fair, pale girl I have so much to say in the pages to come that I
shall not further describe her here.</p>
<p>When the ladies had entered the inn, my companion and I
dismounted, and Manners exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Did you see the glorious girl who but now entered the inn door?
Gods! I never before saw such beauty."</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied, "I know her."</p>
<p>"How fortunate I am," said Sir John. "Perhaps I may induce you
to present me to her. At least you will tell me her name, that I
may seek her acquaintance by the usual means. I am not susceptible,
but by my faith, I&mdash;I&mdash;she looked at me from the
door-steps, and when I caught her eyes it seemed&mdash;that is, I
saw&mdash;or I felt a stream of burning life enter my soul,
and&mdash;but you will think I am a fool. I know I am a fool. But I
feel as if I were&mdash;as if I had been bewitched in one little
second of time, and by a single glance from a pair of brown eyes.
You certainly will think I am a fool, but you cannot
understand&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Why can't I understand?" I asked indignantly. "The thing you
have seen and felt has been in this world long enough for every man
to understand. Eve used it upon Adam. I can't understand? Damme,
sir, do you think I am a clod? I have felt it fifty times."</p>
<p>"Not&mdash;" began Sir John, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" I replied. "You, too, will have the same experience
fifty times again before you are my age."</p>
<p>"But the lady," said Sir John, "tell me of her. Will
you&mdash;can you present me to her? If not, will you tell me who
she is?"</p>
<p>I remained for a moment in thought, wondering if it were right
for me to tell him that the girl whom he so much admired was the
daughter of his father's enemy. I could see no way of keeping
Dorothy's name from him, so I determined to tell him.</p>
<p>"She is my cousin, Mistress Dorothy Vernon," I said.<a name=
"Page_22" id="Page_22"></a> "The eldest is Lady Dorothy Crawford.
The beautiful, pale girl I do not know."</p>
<p>"I am sorry," returned Sir John; "she is the lady whom you have
come to marry, is she not?"</p>
<p>"Y-e-s," said I, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"You certainly are to be congratulated," returned Manners.</p>
<p>"I doubt if I shall marry her," I replied.</p>
<p>"Why?" asked Manners.</p>
<p>"For many reasons, chief among which is her beauty."</p>
<p>"That is an unusual reason for declining a woman," responded Sir
John, with a low laugh.</p>
<p>"I think it is quite usual," I replied, having in mind the
difficulty with which great beauties are won. But I continued, "A
woman of moderate beauty makes a safer wife, and in the long run is
more comforting than one who is too attractive."</p>
<p>"You are a philosopher, Sir Malcolm," said Manners,
laughingly.</p>
<p>"And a liar," I muttered to myself. I felt sure, however, that I
should never marry Dorothy Vernon, and I do not mind telling you,
even at this early stage in my history, that I was right in my
premonition. I did not marry her.</p>
<p>"I suppose I shall now be compelled to give you up to your
relatives," said Manners.</p>
<p>"Yes," I returned, "we must say good-by for the present; but if
we do not meet again, it shall not be for the lack of my wishing.
Your father and Sir George would feel deeply injured, should they
learn of our friendship, therefore&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You are quite right," he interrupted. "It is better that no one
should know of it. Nevertheless, between you and me let there be no
feud."</p>
<p>"The secrecy of our friendship will give it zest," said I. "That
is true, but 'good wine needs no bush.' You will not mention my
name to the ladies?"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>No, if you wish that I shall
not."</p>
<p>"I do so wish."</p>
<p>When the stable boys had taken our horses, I gave my hand to Sir
John, after which we entered the inn and treated each other as
strangers.</p>
<p>Soon after I had washed the stains of travel from my hands and
face, I sent the maid to my cousins, asking that I might be
permitted to pay my devotions, and Dorothy came to the tap-room in
response to my message.</p>
<p>When she entered she ran to me with outstretched hands and a
gleam of welcome in her eyes. We had been rare friends when she was
a child.</p>
<p>"Ah, Cousin Malcolm, what a fine surprise you have given us!"
she exclaimed, clasping both my hands and offering me her cheek to
kiss. "Father's delight will be beyond measure when he sees
you."</p>
<p>"As mine now is," I responded, gazing at her from head to foot
and drinking in her beauty with my eyes. "Doll! Doll! What a
splendid girl you have become. Who would have thought
that&mdash;that&mdash;" I hesitated, realizing that I was rapidly
getting myself into trouble.</p>
<p>"Say it. Say it, cousin! I know what is in your mind. Rusty red
hair, angular shoulders, sharp elbows, freckles thickly set as
stars upon a clear night, and so large and brown that they fairly
twinkled. Great staring green eyes. Awkward!&mdash;" And she threw
up her hands in mimic horror at the remembrance. "No one could have
supposed that such a girl would have become&mdash;that is, you
know," she continued confusedly, "could have changed. I haven't a
freckle now," and she lifted her face that I might prove the truth
of her words by examination, and perhaps that I might also observe
her beauty.</p>
<p>Neither did I waste the opportunity. I dwelt longingly upon the
wondrous red golden hair which fringed her low broad forehead, and
upon the heavy black eyebrows, the <a name="Page_24" id=
"Page_24"></a>pencilled points of whose curves almost touched
across the nose. I saw the rose-tinted ivory of her skin and the
long jet lashes curving in a great sweep from her full white lids,
and I thought full sure that Venus herself was before me. My gaze
halted for a moment at the long eyes which changed chameleon-like
with the shifting light, and varied with her moods from deep
fathomless green to violet, and from violet to soft voluptuous
brown, but in all their tints beaming forth a lustre that would
have stirred the soul of an anchorite. Then I noted the beauty of
her clean-cut saucy nose and the red arch of her lips, slightly
parted for the purpose of showing her teeth. But I could not stop
long to dwell upon any one especial feature, for there were still
to be seen her divine round chin, her large white throat, and the
infinite grace in poise and curve of her strong young form. I dared
not pause nor waste my time if I were to see it all, for such a
girl as Dorothy waits no man's leisure&mdash;that is, unless she
wishes to wait. In such case there is no moving her, and patience
becomes to her a delightful virtue.</p>
<p>After my prolonged scrutiny Dorothy lowered her face and said
laughingly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Now come, cousin, tell me the truth. Who would have thought it
possible?"</p>
<p>"Not I, Doll, not I, if you will pardon me the frankness."</p>
<p>"Oh, that is easily done." Then with a merry ripple of laughter,
"It is much easier, I fancy, for a woman to speak of the time when
she was plain than to refer to the time when&mdash;when she was
beautiful. What an absurd speech that is for me to make," she said
confusedly.</p>
<p>"I certainly did not expect to find so great a change," said I.
"Why, Doll, you are wondrous, glorious, beautiful. I can't find
words&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then don't try, Cousin Malcolm," she said with a smile <a name=
"Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>that fringed her mouth in dimples.
"Don't try. You will make me vain."</p>
<p>"You are that already, Doll," I answered, to tease her.</p>
<p>"I fear I am, cousin&mdash;vain as a man. But don't call me
Doll. I am tall enough to be called Dorothy."</p>
<p>She straightened herself up to her full height, and stepping
close to my side, said: "I am as tall as you. I will now try to
make you vain. You look just as young and as handsome as when I
last saw you and so ardently admired your waving black mustachio
and your curling chin beard."</p>
<p>"Did you admire them, Doll&mdash;Dorothy?" I asked, hoping,
though with little faith, that the admiration might still
continue.</p>
<p>"Oh, prodigiously," she answered with unassuring candor.
"Prodigiously. Now who is vain, Cousin Malcolm Fran&ccedil;ois de
Lorraine Vernon?"</p>
<p>"I," I responded, shrugging my shoulders and confessing by
compulsion.</p>
<p>"But you must remember," she continued provokingly, "that a girl
of twelve is very immature in her judgment and will fall in love
with any man who allows her to look upon him twice."</p>
<p>"Then I am to believe that the fire begins very early to burn in
the feminine heart," I responded.</p>
<p>"With birth, my cousin, with birth," she replied; "but in my
heart it burned itself out upon your curling beard at the mature
age of twelve."</p>
<p>"And you have never been in love since that time,
Doll&mdash;Dorothy?" I asked with more earnestness in my heart than
in my voice.</p>
<p>"No, no; by the Virgin, no! Not even in the shadow of a thought.
And by the help of the Virgin I hope I never shall be; for when it
comes to me, mark my word, cousin, there will be trouble in
Derbyshire."</p>
<p>"By my soul, I believe you speak the truth," I answered,
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>little dreaming how quickly our
joint prophecy would come true.</p>
<p>I then asked Dorothy to tell me about her father.</p>
<p>"Father is well in health," she said. "In mind he has been much
troubled and disturbed. Last month he lost the lawsuit against
detestable old Lord Rutland. He was much angered by the loss, and
has been moody and morose in brooding over it ever since. He tries,
poor father, to find relief from his troubles, and&mdash;and I fear
takes too much liquor. Rutland and his friends swore to one lie
upon another, and father believes that the judge who tried the case
was bribed. Father intends to appeal to Parliament, but even in
Parliament he fears he cannot obtain justice. Lord Rutland's
son&mdash;a disreputable fellow, who for many years has lived at
court&mdash;is a favorite with the queen, and his acquaintance with
her Majesty and with the lords will be to father's prejudice."</p>
<p>"I have always believed that your father stood in the queen's
good graces?" I said interrogatively.</p>
<p>"So he does, but I have been told that this son of Lord Rutland,
whom I have never seen, has the beauty of&mdash;of the devil, and
exercises a great influence over her Majesty and her friends. The
young man is not known in this neighborhood, for he has never
deigned to leave the court; but Lady Cavendish tells me he has all
the fascinations of Satan. I would that Satan had him."</p>
<p>"The feud still lives between Vernon and Rutland?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, and it will continue to live so long as an ounce of blood
can hold a pound of hatred," said the girl, with flashing eyes and
hard lips. "I love to hate the accursed race. They have wronged our
house for three generations, and my father has suffered greater
injury at their hands than any of our name. Let us not talk of the
hateful subject."</p>
<p>We changed the topic. I had expected Dorothy to in<a name=
"Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>vite me to go with her to meet Lady
Crawford, but the girl seemed disinclined to leave the tap-room.
The Peacock was her father's property, and the host and hostess
were her friends after the manner of persons in their degree.
Therefore Dorothy felt at liberty to visit the tap-room quite as
freely as if it had been the kitchen of Haddon Hall.</p>
<p>During our conversation I had frequently noticed Dorothy
glancing slyly in the direction of the fireplace; but my back was
turned that way, and I did not know, nor did it at first occur to
me to wonder what attracted her attention. Soon she began to lose
the thread of our conversation, and made inappropriate, tardy
replies to my remarks. The glances toward the fireplace increased
in number and duration, and her efforts to pay attention to what I
was saying became painful failures.</p>
<p>After a little time she said: "Is it not cool here? Let us go
over to the fireplace where it is warmer."</p>
<p>I turned to go with her, and at once saw that it was not the
fire in the fireplace which had attracted Dorothy, but quite a
different sort of flame. In short, much to my consternation, I
discovered that it was nothing less than my handsome new-found
friend, Sir John Manners, toward whom Dorothy had been
glancing.</p>
<p>We walked over to the fireplace, and one of the fires, Sir John,
moved away. But the girl turned her face that she might see him in
his new position. The movement, I confess, looked bold to the point
of brazenness; but if the movement was bold, what shall I say of
her glances and the expression of her face? She seemed unable to
take her eager eyes from the stranger, or to think of anything but
him, and after a few moments she did not try. Soon she stopped
talking entirely and did not even hear what I was saying. I, too,
became silent, and after a long pause the girl asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>Cousin, who is the gentleman
with whom you were travelling?"</p>
<p>I was piqued by Dorothy's conduct, and answered rather curtly:
"He is a stranger. I picked him up at Derby, and we rode here
together."</p>
<p>A pause followed, awkward in its duration.</p>
<p>"Did you&mdash;not&mdash;learn&mdash;his&mdash;name?" asked
Dorothy, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>
<p>Then came another pause, broken by the girl, who spoke in a
quick, imperious tone touched with irritation:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>
<p>"It is better that I do not tell you," I answered. "It was quite
by accident that we met. Neither of us knew the other. Please do
not ask me to tell you his name."</p>
<p>"Oh, but you make me all the more eager to learn. Mystery, you
know, is intolerable to a woman, except in the unravelling. Come,
tell me! Tell me! Not, of course, that I really care a farthing to
know&mdash;but the mystery! A mystery drives me wild. Tell me,
please do, Cousin Malcolm."</p>
<p>She certainly was posing for the stranger's benefit, and was
doing all in her power, while coaxing me, to display her charms,
graces, and pretty little ways. Her attitude and conduct spoke as
plainly as the spring bird's song speaks to its mate. Yet Dorothy's
manner did not seem bold. Even to me it appeared modest, beautiful,
and necessary. She seemed to act under compulsion. She would laugh,
for the purpose, no doubt, of showing her dimples and her teeth,
and would lean her head to one side pigeon-wise to display her eyes
to the best advantage, and then would she shyly glance toward Sir
John to see if he was watching her. It was shameless, but it could
not be helped by Dorothy nor any one else. After a few <a name=
"Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>moments of mute pleading by the girl,
broken now and then by, "Please, please," I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If you give to me your promise that you will never speak of
this matter to any person, I will tell you the gentleman's name. I
would not for a great deal have your father know that I have held
conversation with him even for a moment, though at the time I did
not know who he was."</p>
<p>"Oh, this is delightful! He must be some famous, dashing
highwayman. I promise, of course I promise&mdash;faithfully." She
was glancing constantly toward Manners, and her face was bright
with smiles and eager with anticipation.</p>
<p>"He is worse than a highwayman, I regret to say. The gentleman
toward whom you are so ardently glancing is&mdash;Sir John
Manners."</p>
<p>A shock of pain passed over Dorothy's face, followed by a hard,
repellent expression that was almost ugly.</p>
<p>"Let us go to Aunt Dorothy," she said, as she turned and walked
across the room toward the door.</p>
<p>When we had closed the door of the tap-room behind us Dorothy
said angrily:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Tell me, cousin, how you, a Vernon, came to be in his
company?"</p>
<p>"I told you that I met him quite by accident at the Royal Arms
in Derby-town. We became friends before either knew the other's
name. After chance had disclosed our identities, he asked for a
truce to our feud until the morrow; and he was so gentle and open
in his conduct that I could not and would not refuse his proffered
olive branch. In truth, whatever faults may be attributable to Lord
Rutland,&mdash;and I am sure he deserves all the evil you have
spoken of him,&mdash;his son, Sir John, is a noble gentleman, else
I have been reading the book of human nature all my life in vain.
Perhaps he is in no way to <a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>blame
for his father's conduct He may have had no part in it"</p>
<p>"Perhaps he has not," said Dorothy, musingly.</p>
<p>It was not a pleasant task for me to praise Sir John, but my
sense of justice impelled me to do so. I tried to make myself feel
injured and chagrined because of Dorothy's manner toward him; for
you must remember I had arranged with myself to marry this girl,
but I could not work my feelings into a state of indignation
against the heir to Rutland. The truth is, my hope of winning
Dorothy had evaporated upon the first sight of her, like the
volatile essence it really was. I cannot tell you why, but I at
once seemed to realize that all the thought and labor which I had
devoted to the arduous task of arranging with myself this marriage
was labor lost. So I frankly told her my kindly feelings for Sir
John, and gave her my high estimate of his character.</p>
<p>I continued: "You see, Dorothy, I could not so easily explain to
your father my association with Sir John, and I hope you will not
speak of it to any one, lest the news should reach Sir George's
ears."</p>
<p>"I will not speak of it," she returned, sighing faintly. "After
all, it is not his fault that his father is such a villain. He
doesn't look like his father, does he?"</p>
<p>"I cannot say. I never saw Lord Rutland," I replied.</p>
<p>"He is the most villanous-looking&mdash;" but she broke off the
sentence and stood for a moment in revery. We were in the darkened
passage, and Dorothy had taken my hand. That little act in another
woman of course would have led to a demonstration on my part, but
in this girl it seemed so entirely natural and candid that it was a
complete bar to undue familiarity. In truth, I had no such
tendency, for the childish act spoke of an innocence and faith that
were very sweet to me who all my life had lived <a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31"></a>among men and women who laughed at those simple
virtues. The simple conditions of life are all that are worth
striving for. They come to us fresh from Nature and from Nature's
God. The complex are but concoctions of man after recipes in the
devil's alchemy. So much gold, so much ambition, so much lust. Mix
well. Product: so much vexation.</p>
<p>"He must resemble his mother," said Dorothy, after a long pause.
"Poor fellow! His mother is dead. He is like me in that respect. I
wonder if his father's villanies trouble him?"</p>
<p>"I think they must trouble him. He seems to be sad," said I,
intending to be ironical.</p>
<p>My reply was taken seriously.</p>
<p>"I am sorry for him," she said, "it is not right to hate even
our enemies. The Book tells us that."</p>
<p>"Yet you hate Lord Rutland," said I, amused and provoked.</p>
<p>Unexpected and dangerous symptoms were rapidly developing in the
perverse girl, and trouble was brewing "in Derbyshire."</p>
<p>The adjective perverse, by the way, usually is superfluous when
used to modify the noun girl.</p>
<p>"Yet you hate Lord Rutland," I repeated.</p>
<p>"Why, y-e-s," she responded. "I cannot help that, but you know
it would be very wrong to&mdash;to hate all his family. To hate him
is bad enough."</p>
<p>I soon began to fear that I had praised Sir John overmuch.</p>
<p>"I think Sir John is all there is of Lord Rutland's family," I
said, alarmed yet amused at Dorothy's search for an excuse not to
hate my new-found friend.</p>
<p>"Well," she continued after a pause, throwing her head to one
side, "I am sorry there are no more of that family not to
hate."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>Dorothy! Dorothy!" I
exclaimed. "What has come over you? You surprise me."</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered, with a little sigh, "I certainly have
surprised myself by&mdash;by my willingness to forgive those who
have injured my house. I did not know there was so much&mdash;so
much good in me."</p>
<p>"Mistress Pharisee," thought I, "you are a hypocrite."</p>
<p>Again intending to be ironical, I said, "Shall I fetch him from
the tap-room and present him to you?"</p>
<p>Once more my irony was lost upon the girl. Evidently that sort
of humor was not my strong point.</p>
<p>"No, no," she responded indignantly, "I would not speak to him
for&mdash;" Again she broke her sentence abruptly, and after a
little pause, short in itself but amply long for a girl like
Dorothy to change her mind two score times, she continued: "It
would not be for the best. What think you, Cousin Malcolm?"</p>
<p>"Surely the girl has gone mad," thought I. Her voice was soft
and conciliating as if to say, "I trust entirely to your mature,
superior judgment."</p>
<p>My judgment coincided emphatically with her words, and I said:
"I spoke only in jest. It certainly would not be right. It would be
all wrong if you were to meet him."</p>
<p>"That is true," the girl responded with firmness, "but&mdash;but
no real harm could come of it," she continued, laughing nervously.
"He could not strike me nor bite me. Of course it would be
unpleasant for me to meet him, and as there is no need&mdash;I am
curious to know what one of his race is like. It's the only reason
that would induce me to consent. Of course you know there could be
no other reason for me to wish&mdash;that is, you know&mdash;to be
willing to meet him. Of course you know."</p>
<p>"Certainly," I replied, still clinging to my unsuccessful irony.
"I will tell you all I know about him, so that you <a name=
"Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>may understand what he is like. As for
his personal appearance, you saw him, did you not?"</p>
<p>I thought surely that piece of irony would not fail, but it did,
and I have seldom since attempted to use that form of humor.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;oh, yes, I saw him for a moment."</p>
<p>"But I will not present him to you, Dorothy, however much you
may wish to meet him," I said positively.</p>
<p>"It is almost an insult, Cousin Malcolm, for you to say that I
wish to meet him," she answered in well-feigned indignation.</p>
<p>The French blood in my veins moved me to shrug my shoulders. I
could do nothing else. With all my knowledge of womankind this girl
had sent me to sea.</p>
<p>But what shall we say of Dorothy's conduct? I fancy I can hear
you mutter, "This Dorothy Vernon must have been a bold, immodest,
brazen girl." Nothing of the sort. Dare you of the cold
blood&mdash;if perchance there be any with that curse in their
veins who read these lines&mdash;dare you, I say, lift your voice
against the blessed heat in others which is but a greater,
stronger, warmer spark of God's own soul than you possess or than
you can comprehend? "Evil often comes of it," I hear you say. That
I freely admit; and evil comes from eating too much bread, and from
hearing too much preaching. But the universe, from the humblest
blade of grass to the infinite essence of God, exists because of
that warmth which the mawkish world contemns. Is the iron immodest
when it creeps to the lodestone and clings to its side? Is the hen
bird brazen when she flutters to her mate responsive to his
compelling woo-song? Is the seed immodest when it sinks into the
ground and swells with budding life? Is the cloud bold when it
softens into rain and falls to earth because it has no other
choice? or is it brazen when it nestles for a time on the bosom of
heaven's <a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>arched dome and sinking
into the fathomless depths of a blue black infinity ceases to be
itself? Is the human soul immodest when, drawn by a force it cannot
resist, it seeks a stronger soul which absorbs its ego as the blue
sky absorbs the floating cloud, as the warm earth swells the seed,
as the magnet draws the iron? All these are of one quality. The
iron, the seed, the cloud, and the soul of man are <i>what</i> they
are, do <i>what</i> they do, love as they love, live as they live,
and die as they die because they must&mdash;because they have no
other choice. We think we are free because at times we act as we
please, forgetting that God gives us the "please," and that every
act of our being is but the result of a dictated motive. Dorothy
was not immodest. This was her case. She was the iron, the seed,
the cloud, and the rain. You, too, are the iron, the seed, the
cloud, and the rain. It is only human vanity which prompts you to
believe that you are yourself and that you are free. Do you find
any freedom in this world save that which you fondly believe to
exist within yourself? Self! There is but one self, God. I have
been told that the people of the East call Him Brahma. The word, it
is said, means "Breath," "Inspiration," "All." I have felt that the
beautiful pagan thought has truth in it; but my conscience and my
priest tell me rather to cling to truths I have than to fly to
others that I know not of. As a result, I shall probably die
orthodox and mistaken.</p>

<h2>THE PITCHER GOES TO THE WELL.</h2>
<p>Dorothy and I went to the inn parlors, where I received a
cordial welcome from my cousin, Lady Crawford. After our greeting,
Dorothy came toward me leading the fair, pale girl whom I had seen
in the courtyard.</p>
<p>"Madge, this is my cousin, Malcolm Vernon," said Dorothy. "He
was a dear friend of my childhood and is much beloved by my father.
Lady Magdalene Stanley, cousin," and she placed the girl's soft
white hand in mine. There was a peculiar hesitancy in the girl's
manner which puzzled me. She did not look at me when Dorothy placed
her hand in mine, but kept her eyes cast down, the long, black
lashes resting upon the fair curves of her cheek like a shadow on
the snow. She murmured a salutation, and when I made a remark that
called for a response, she lifted her eyes but seemed not to look
at me. Unconsciously I turned my face toward Dorothy, who closed
her eyes and formed with her lips the word "blind."</p>
<p>I retained the girl's hand, and she did not withdraw it. When I
caught Dorothy's unspoken word I led Lady Madge to a chair and
asked if I might sit beside her.</p>
<p>"Certainly," she answered smilingly; "you know I am blind, but I
can hear and speak, and I enjoy having persons I like sit near me
that I may touch them now and then while we talk. If I could only
see!" she exclaimed.<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a> Still,
there was no tone of complaint in her voice and very little even of
regret. The girl's eyes were of a deep blue and were entirely
without scar or other evidence of blindness, except that they did
not seem to see. I afterward learned that her affliction had come
upon her as the result of illness when she was a child. She was
niece to the Earl of Derby, and Dorothy's mother had been her aunt.
She owned a small estate and had lived at Haddon Hall five or six
years because of the love that existed between her and Dorothy. A
strong man instinctively longs to cherish that which needs his
strength, and perhaps it was the girl's helplessness that first
appealed to me. Perhaps it was her rare, peculiar beauty, speaking
eloquently of virtue such as I had never known, that touched me. I
cannot say what the impelling cause was, but this I know: my heart
went out in pity to her, and all that was good within
me&mdash;good, which I had never before suspected&mdash;stirred in
my soul, and my past life seemed black and barren beyond endurance.
Even Dorothy's marvellous beauty lacked the subtle quality which
this simple blind girl possessed. The first step in regeneration is
to see one's faults; the second is to regret them; the third is to
quit them. The first and second steps constitute repentance; the
second and third regeneration. One hour within the radius of Madge
Stanley's influence brought me to repentance. But repentance is an
everyday virtue. Should I ever achieve regeneration? That is one of
the questions this history will answer. To me, Madge Stanley's
passive force was the strongest influence for good that had ever
impinged on my life. With respect to her, morally, I was the iron,
the seed, the cloud, and the rain, for she, acting unconsciously,
moved me with neither knowledge nor volition on my part.</p>
<p>Soon after my arrival at the ladies' parlor dinner was served,
and after dinner a Persian merchant was ushered <a name="Page_37"
id="Page_37"></a>in, closely followed by his servants bearing bales
of rare Eastern fabrics. A visit and a dinner at the inn were
little events that made a break in the monotony of life at the
Hall, and the ladies preferred to visit the merchant, who was
stopping at The Peacock for a time, rather than to have him take
his wares to Haddon.</p>
<p>While Lady Crawford and Dorothy were revelling in Persian silks,
satins, and gold cloths, I sat by Lady Madge and was more than
content that we were left to ourselves. My mind, however, was as
far from thoughts of gallantry as if she had been a black-veiled
nun. I believe I have not told you that I was of the Holy Catholic
Faith. My religion, I may say, has always been more nominal and
political than spiritual, although there ran through it a strong
vein of inherited tendencies and superstitions which were highly
colored by contempt for heresy and heretics. I was Catholic by
habit. But if I analyzed my supposed religious belief, I found that
I had none save a hatred for heresy. Heretics, as a rule, were
low-born persons, vulgarly moral, and as I had always thought,
despisedly hypocritical. Madge Stanley, however, was a Protestant,
and that fact shook the structure of my old mistakes to its
foundation, and left me religionless.</p>
<p>After the Persian merchant had packed his bales and departed,
Dorothy and Lady Crawford joined Madge and me near the fireplace.
Soon Dorothy went over to the window and stood there gazing into
the courtyard. After a few minutes Lady Crawford said, "Dorothy,
had we not better order Dawson to bring out the horses and coach?"
Will Dawson was Sir George's forester. Lady Crawford repeated her
question, but Dorothy was too intently watching the scene in the
courtyard to hear. I went over to her, and looking out at the
window discovered the object of Dorothy's rapt attention. There is
no need for me to tell you who it was. Irony, as you know, <a name=
"Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>and as I had learned, was harmless
against this thick-skinned nymph. Of course I had no authority to
scold her, so I laughed. The object of Dorothy's attention was
about to mount his horse. He was drawing on his gauntleted gloves
and held between his teeth a cigarro. He certainly presented a
handsome figure for the eyes of an ardent girl to rest upon while
he stood beneath the window, clothed in a fashionable Paris-made
suit of brown, doublet, trunks, and hose. His high-topped boots
were polished till they shone, and his broad-rimmed hat, of soft
beaver, was surmounted by a flowing plume. Even I, who had no
especial taste nor love for masculine beauty, felt my sense of the
beautiful strongly moved by the attractive picture my new-found
friend presented. His dress, manner, and bearing, polished by the
friction of life at a luxurious court, must have appeared god-like
to Dorothy. She had never travelled farther from home than Buxton
and Derby-town, and had met only the half-rustic men belonging to
the surrounding gentry and nobility of Derbyshire, Nottingham, and
Stafford. She had met but few even of them, and their lives had
been spent chiefly in drinking, hunting, and
gambling&mdash;accomplishments that do not fine down the texture of
a man's nature or fit him for a lady's bower. Sir John Manners was
a revelation to Dorothy; and she, poor girl, was bewildered and
bewitched by him.</p>
<p>When John had mounted and was moving away, he looked up to the
window where Dorothy stood, and a light came to her eyes and a
smile to her face which no man who knows the sum of two and two can
ever mistake if he but once sees it.</p>
<p>When I saw the light in Dorothy's eyes, I knew that all the
hatred that was ever born from all the feuds that had ever lived
since the quarrelling race of man began its feuds in Eden could not
make Dorothy Vernon hate the son of her father's enemy.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>I
was&mdash;was&mdash;watching him draw smoke through the&mdash;the
little stick which he holds in his mouth, and&mdash;and blow it out
again," said Dorothy, in explanation of her attitude. She blushed
painfully and continued, "I hope you do not think&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I do not think," I answered. "I would not think of
thinking."</p>
<p>"Of course not," she responded, with a forced smile, as she
watched Sir John pass out of sight under the arch of the innyard
gate. I did not think. I knew. And the sequel, so full of trouble,
soon proved that I was right. After John had passed through the
gate, Dorothy was willing to go home; and when Will Dawson brought
the great coach to the inn door, I mounted my horse and rode beside
the ladies to Haddon Hall, two miles north from Rowsley.</p>
<p>I shall not stop to tell you of the warm welcome given me by Sir
George Vernon, nor of his delight when I briefly told him my
misfortunes in Scotland&mdash;misfortunes that had brought me to
Haddon Hall. Nor shall I describe the great boar's head supper
given in my honor, at which there were twenty men who could have
put me under the table. I thought I knew something of the art of
drinking, but at that supper I soon found I was a mere tippler
compared with these country guzzlers. At that feast I learned also
that Dorothy, when she had hinted concerning Sir George's excessive
drinking, had told the truth. He, being the host, drank with all
his guests. Near midnight he grew distressingly drunk, talkative,
and violent, and when toward morning he was carried from the room
by his servants, the company broke up. Those who could do so reeled
home; those who could not walk at all were put to bed by the
retainers at Haddon Hall. I had chosen my bedroom high up in Eagle
Tower. At table I had tried to remain sober. That, however, was an
impossible task, for at the <a name="Page_40" id=
"Page_40"></a>upper end of the hail there was a wrist-ring placed
in the wainscoting at a height of ten or twelve inches above the
head of an ordinary man, and if he refused to drink as much as the
other guests thought he should, his wrist was fastened above his
head in the ring, and the liquor which he should have poured down
his throat was poured down his sleeve. Therefore to avoid this
species of rustic sport I drank much more than was good for me.
When the feast closed I thought I was sober enough to go to my room
unassisted; so I took a candle, and with a great show of
self-confidence climbed the spiral stone stairway to the door of my
room. The threshold of my door was two or three feet above the
steps of the stairway, and after I had contemplated the distance
for a few minutes, I concluded that it would not be safe for me to
attempt to climb into my sleeping apartments without help.
Accordingly I sat down upon the step on which I had been standing,
placed my candle beside me, called loudly for a servant, received
no response, and fell asleep only to be awakened by one of Sir
George's retainers coming downstairs next morning.</p>
<p>After that supper, in rapid succession, followed hunting and
drinking, feasting and dancing in my honor. At the dances the
pipers furnished the music, or, I should rather say, the noise.
Their miserable wailings reminded me of Scotland. After all,
thought I, is the insidious, polished vice of France worse than the
hoggish, uncouth practices of Scotland and of English country life?
I could not endure the latter, so I asked Sir George, on the
pretext of ill health, to allow me to refuse invitations to other
houses, and I insisted that he should give no more entertainments
at Haddon Hall on my account. Sir George eagerly acquiesced in all
my wishes. In truth, I was treated like an honored guest and a
member of the family, and I congratulated myself that my life had
fallen in such pleasant lines. Dorothy and Madge became my constant
com<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>panions, for Sir George's
time was occupied chiefly with his estates and with his duties as
magistrate. A feeling of rest and contentment came over me, and my
past life drifted back of me like an ever receding cloud.</p>
<p>Thus passed the months of October and November.</p>
<p>In the meantime events in Scotland and in England proved my
wisdom in seeking a home at Haddon Hall, and showed me how great
was my good fortune in finding it.</p>
<p>Queen Mary was a prisoner at Lochleven Castle, and her brother
Murray had beheaded many of her friends. Elizabeth, hating Mary as
only a plain, envious woman can hate one who is transcendently
beautiful, had, upon different pretexts, seized many of Mary's
friends who had fled to England for sanctuary, and some of them had
suffered imprisonment or death.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, in many instances, had good cause for her attitude
toward Mary's friends, since plots were hatching thick and fast to
liberate Mary from Lochleven; and many such plots, undoubtedly, had
for their chief end the deposition of Elizabeth, and the
enthronement of Mary as Queen of England.</p>
<p>As a strict matter of law, Mary was rightful heir to the English
throne, and Elizabeth was an usurper. Parliament, at Henry's
request, had declared that Elizabeth, his issue by Anne Boleyn, was
illegitimate, and that being true, Mary was next in line of
descent. The Catholics of England took that stand, and Mary's
beauty and powers of fascination had won for her friends even in
the personal household of the Virgin Queen. Small cause for wonder
was it that Elizabeth, knowing all these facts, looked with
suspicion and fear upon Mary's refugee friends.</p>
<p>The English queen well knew that Sir George Vernon was her
friend, therefore his house and his friendship were <a name=
"Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>my sanctuary, without which my days
certainly would have been numbered in the land of Elizabeth, and
their number would have been small. I was dependent on Sir George
not only for a roof to shelter me, but for my very life. I speak of
these things that you may know some of the many imperative reasons
why I desired to please and conciliate my cousin. In addition to
those reasons, I soon grew to love Sir George, not only because of
his kindness to me, but because he was a lovable man. He was
generous, just, and frank, and although at times he was violent
almost to the point of temporary madness, his heart was usually
gentle, and was as easily touched by kindness as it was quickly
moved to cruelty by injury, fancied or actual. I have never known a
more cruel, tender man than he. You will see him in each of his
natures before you have finished this history. But you must judge
him only after you have considered his times, which were forty
years ago, his surroundings, and his blood.</p>
<p>During those two months remarkable changes occurred within the
walls of Haddon, chief of which were in myself, and, alas! in
Dorothy.</p>
<p>My pilgrimage to Haddon, as you already know, had been made for
the purpose of marrying my fair cousin; for I did not, at the time
I left Scotland, suppose I should need Sir George's protection
against Elizabeth. When I met Dorothy at Rowsley, my desire to
marry her became personal, in addition to the mercenary motives
with which I had originally started. But I quickly recognized the
fact that the girl was beyond my reach. I knew I could not win her
love, even though I had a thousand years to try for it; and I would
not accept her hand in marriage solely at her father's command. I
also soon learned that Dorothy was the child of her father, gentle,
loving, and tender beyond the naming, but also wilful, violent, and
fierce to the extent that no command could influence her.</p>
<p><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>First I shall speak of the
change within myself. I will soon be done with so much "I" and
"me," and you shall have Dorothy to your heart's content, or
trouble, I know not which.</p>
<p>Soon after my arrival at Haddon Hall the sun ushered in one of
those wonderful days known only to the English autumn, when the
hush of Nature's drowsiness, just before her long winter's sleep,
imparts its soft restfulness to man, as if it were a lotus feast.
Dorothy was ostentatiously busy with her household matters, and was
consulting with butler, cook, and steward. Sir George had ridden
out to superintend his men at work, and I, wandering aimlessly
about the hail, came upon Madge Stanley sitting in the chaplain's
room with folded hands.</p>
<p>"Lady Madge, will you go with me for a walk this beautiful
morning?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Gladly would I go, Sir Malcolm," she responded, a smile
brightening her face and quickly fading away, "but I&mdash;I cannot
walk in unfamiliar places. I should fail. You would have to lead me
by the hand, and that, I fear, would mar the pleasure of your
walk."</p>
<p>"Indeed, it would not, Lady Madge. I should enjoy my walk all
the more."</p>
<p>"If you really wish me to go, I shall be delighted," she
responded, as the brightness came again to her face. "I sometimes
grow weary, and, I confess, a little sad sitting alone when Dorothy
cannot be with me. Aunt Dorothy, now that she has her magnifying
glasses,&mdash;spectacles, I think they are called,&mdash;devotes
all her time to reading, and dislikes to be interrupted."</p>
<p>"I wish it very much," I said, surprised by the real eagerness
of my desire, and unconsciously endeavoring to keep out of the
tones of my voice a part of that eagerness.</p>
<p>"I shall take you at your word," she said. "I will go to my room
to get my hat and cloak."</p>
<p><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>She rose and began to grope
her way toward the door, holding out her white, expressive hands in
front of her. It was pitiful and beautiful to see her, and my
emotions welled up in my throat till I could hardly speak.</p>
<p>"Permit me to give you my hand," I said huskily. How I longed to
carry her! Every man with the right sort of a heart in his breast
has a touch of the mother instinct in him; but, alas I only a
touch. Ah, wondrous and glorious womanhood! If you had naught but
the mother instinct to lift you above your masters by the hand of
man-made laws, those masters were still unworthy to tie the strings
of your shoes.</p>
<p>"Thank you," said the girl, as she clasped my hand, and moved
with confidence by my side. "This is so much better than the
dreadful fear of falling. Even through these rooms where I have
lived for many years I feel safe only in a few places,&mdash;on the
stairs, and in my rooms, which are also Dorothy's. When Dorothy
changes the position of a piece of furniture in the Hall, she leads
me to it several times that I may learn just where it is. A long
time ago she changed the position of a chair and did not tell me. I
fell against it and was hurt. Dorothy wept bitterly over the
mishap, and she has never since failed to tell me of such changes.
I cannot make you know how kind and tender Dorothy is to me. I feel
that I should die without her, and I know she would grieve terribly
were we to part."</p>
<p>I could not answer. What a very woman you will think I was! I,
who could laugh while I ran my sword through a man's heart, could
hardly restrain my tears for pity of this beautiful blind girl.</p>
<p>"Thank you; that will do," she said, when we came to the foot of
the great staircase. "I can now go to my rooms alone."</p>
<p>When she reached the top she hesitated and groped for <a name=
"Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>a moment; then she turned and called
laughingly to me while I stood at the bottom of the steps, "I know
the way perfectly well, but to go alone in any place is not like
being led."</p>
<p>"There are many ways in which one may be led, Lady Madge," I
answered aloud. Then I said to myself, "That girl will lead you to
Heaven, Malcolm, if you will permit her to do so."</p>
<p>But thirty-five years of evil life are hard to neutralize. There
is but one subtle elixir that can do it&mdash;love; and I had not
thought of that magic remedy with respect to Madge.</p>
<p>I hurriedly fetched my hat and returned to the foot of the
staircase. Within a minute or two Madge came down stairs holding up
the skirt of her gown with one hand, while she grasped the banister
with the other. As I watched her descending I was enraptured with
her beauty. Even the marvellous vital beauty of Dorothy could not
compare with this girl's fair, pale loveliness. It seemed to be
almost a profanation for me to admire the sweet oval of her face.
Upon her alabaster skin, the black eyebrows, the long lashes, the
faint blue veins and the curving red lips stood in exquisite
relief. While she was descending the stairs, I caught a gleam of
her round, snowy forearm and wrist; and when my eyes sought the
perfect curves of her form disclosed by the clinging silk gown she
wore, I felt that I had sinned in looking upon her, and I was
almost glad she could not see the shame which was in my face.</p>
<p>"Cousin Malcolm, are you waiting?" she asked from midway in the
staircase.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am at the foot of the steps," I answered.</p>
<p>"I called you 'Cousin Malcolm,'" she said, holding out her hand
when she came near me. "Pardon me; it was a slip of the tongue. I
hear 'Cousin Malcolm' so frequently from Dorothy that the name is
familiar to me."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>I shall be proud if you will
call me 'Cousin Malcolm' always. I like the name better than any
that you can use."</p>
<p>"If you wish it," she said, in sweet, simple candor, "I will
call you 'Cousin Malcolm,' and you may call me 'Cousin Madge' or
'Madge,' just as you please."</p>
<p>"'Cousin Madge' it shall be; that is a compact," I answered, as
I opened the door and we walked out into the fresh air of the
bright October morning.</p>
<p>"That will stand for our first compact; we are progressing
famously," she said, with a low laugh of delight.</p>
<p>Ah, to think that the blind can laugh. God is good.</p>
<p>We walked out past the stables and the cottage, and crossed the
river on the great stone bridge. Then we took our way down the
babbling Wye, keeping close to its banks, while the dancing waters
and even the gleaming pebbles seemed to dimple and smile as they
softly sang their song of welcome to the fair kindred spirit who
had come to visit them. If we wandered from the banks for but a
moment, the waters seemed to struggle and turn in their course
until they were again by her side, and then would they gently flow
and murmur their contentment as they travelled forward to the sea,
full of the memory of her sweet presence. And during all that time
I led her by the hand. I tell you, friends, 'tis sweet to write of
it.</p>
<p>When we returned we crossed the Wye by the stone footbridge and
entered the garden below the terrace at the corner postern. We
remained for an hour resting upon the terrace balustrade, and
before we went indoors Madge again spoke of Dorothy.</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you how much I have enjoyed this walk, nor how
thankful I am to you for taking me," she said.</p>
<p>I did not interrupt her by replying, for I loved to hear her
talk.</p>
<p>"Dorothy sometimes takes me with her for a short <a name=
"Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>walk, but I seldom have that pleasure.
Walking is too slow for Dorothy. She is so strong and full of life.
She delights to ride her mare Dolcy. Have you seen Dolcy?"</p>
<p>"No," I responded.</p>
<p>"You must see her at once. She is the most beautiful animal in
the world. Though small of limb, she is swift as the wind, and as
easy as a cradle in her gaits. She is mettlesome and fiery, but
full of affection. She often kisses Dorothy. Mare and rider are
finely mated. Dorothy is the most perfect woman, and Dolcy is the
most perfect mare. 'The two D's,' we call them. But Dorothy says we
must be careful not to put a&mdash;a dash between them," she said
with a laugh and a blush.</p>
<p>Then I led Madge into the hall, and she was blithe and happy as
if the blessed light of day were in her eyes. It was in her soul,
and that, after all, is where it brings the greatest good.</p>
<p>After that morning, Madge and I frequently walked out when the
days were pleasant. The autumn was mild, well into winter time, and
by the end of November the transparent cheeks of the blind girl
held an exquisite tinge of color, and her form had a new grace from
the strength she had acquired in exercise. We had grown to be dear
friends, and the touch of her hand was a pleasure for which I
waited eagerly from day to day. Again I say thoughts of love for
her had never entered my mind. Perhaps their absence was because of
my feeling that they could not possibly exist in her heart for
me.</p>
<p>One evening in November, after the servants had all gone to bed,
Sir George and I went to the kitchen to drink a hot punch before
retiring for the night. I drank a moderate bowl and sat in a large
chair before the fire, smoking a pipe of tobacco, while Sir George
drank brandy toddy at the massive oak table in the middle of the
room.</p>
<p>Sir George was rapidly growing drunk. He said:<a name="Page_48"
id="Page_48"></a> "Dawson tells me that the queen's officers
arrested another of Mary Stuart's damned French friends at
Derby-town yesterday,&mdash;Count somebody; I can't pronounce their
miserable names."</p>
<p>"Can you not remember his name?" I asked. "He may be a friend of
mine." My remark was intended to remind Sir George that his
language was offensive to me.</p>
<p>"That is true, Malcolm," responded Sir George. "I beg your
pardon. I meant to speak ill only of Mary's meddlesome friends, who
are doing more injury than good to their queen's cause by their
plotting."</p>
<p>I replied: "No one can regret these plots more than I do. They
certainly will work great injury to the cause they are intended to
help. But I fear many innocent men are made to suffer for the few
guilty ones. Without your protection, for which I cannot
sufficiently thank you, my life here would probably be of short
duration. After my misfortunes in Scotland, I know not what I
should have done had it not been for your generous welcome. I lost
all in Scotland, and it would now be impossible for me to go to
France. An attempt on my part to escape would result in my arrest.
Fortune certainly has turned her capricious back upon me, with the
one exception that she has left me your friendship."</p>
<p>"Malcolm, my boy," said Sir George, drawing his chair toward me,
"that which you consider your loss is my great gain. I am growing
old, and if you, who have seen so much of the gay world, will be
content to live with us and share our dulness and our cares, I
shall be the happiest man in England."</p>
<p>"I thank you more than I can tell," I said, careful not to
commit myself to any course.</p>
<p>"Barring my quarrel with the cursed race of Manners," continued
Sir George, "I have little to trouble me; and if you will remain
with us, I thank God I may leave the feud <a name="Page_49" id=
"Page_49"></a>in good hands. Would that I were young again only for
a day that I might call that scoundrel Rutland and his imp of a son
to account in the only manner whereby an honest man may have
justice of a thief. There are but two of them,
Malcolm,&mdash;father and son,&mdash;and if they were dead, the
damned race would be extinct."</p>
<p>I believe that Sir George Vernon when sober could not have
spoken in that fashion even of his enemies.</p>
<p>I found difficulty in replying to my cousin's remarks, so I said
evasively:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I certainly am the most fortunate of men to find so warm a
welcome from you, and so good a home as that which I have at Haddon
Hall. When I met Dorothy at the inn, I knew at once by her kindness
that my friends of old were still true to me. I was almost stunned
by Dorothy's beauty."</p>
<p>My mention of Dorothy was unintentional and unfortunate. I had
shied from the subject upon several previous occasions, but Sir
George was continually trying to lead up to it. This time my lack
of forethought saved him the trouble.</p>
<p>"Do you really think that Doll is very beautiful&mdash;so very
beautiful? Do you really think so, Malcolm?" said the old
gentleman, rubbing his hands in pride and pleasure.</p>
<p>"Surprisingly beautiful," I answered, seeking hurriedly through
my mind for an excuse to turn the conversation. I had within two
months learned one vital fact: beautiful as Dorothy was, I did not
want her for my wife, and I could not have had her even were I
dying for love. The more I learned of Dorothy and myself during the
autumn through which I had just passed&mdash;and I had learned more
of myself than I had been able to discover in the thirty-five
previous years of my life&mdash;the more clearly I saw the utter
unfitness of marriage between us.</p>
<p>"In all your travels," asked Sir George, leaning his <a name=
"Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>elbows upon his knees and looking at his
feet between his hands, "in all your travels and court life have
you ever seen a woman who was so beautiful as my girl Doll?"</p>
<p>His pride in Dorothy at times had a tinge of egotism and
selfishness. It seemed to be almost the pride of possession and
ownership. "My girl!" The expression and the tone in which the
words were spoken sounded as if he had said: "My fine horse," "My
beautiful Hall," or "My grand estates." Dorothy was his property.
Still, he loved the girl passionately. She was dearer to him than
all his horses, cattle, halls, and estates put together, and he
loved even them to excess. He loved all that he possessed; whatever
was his was the best of the sort. Such a love is apt to grow up in
the breasts of men who have descended from a long line of
proprietary ancestors, and with all its materialism it has in it
possibilities of great good. The sturdy, unflinching patriotism of
the English people springs from this source. The thought, "That
which I possess is the best," has beauty and use in it, though it
leads men to treat other men, and, alas! women, as mere chattels.
All this was passing through my mind, and I forgot to answer Sir
George's question.</p>
<p>"Have you ever seen a woman more beautiful than Doll?" he again
asked.</p>
<p>"I certainly have never seen one whose beauty may even be
compared with Dorothy's," I answered.</p>
<p>"And she is young, too," continued Sir George; "she is not yet
nineteen."</p>
<p>"That is very young," I answered, not knowing what else to
say.</p>
<p>"And she will be rich some day. Very rich. I am called 'King of
the Peak,' you know, and there are not three estates in Derbyshire
which, if combined, would equal mine."</p>
<p>"That is true, cousin," I answered, "and I rejoice in your good
fortune."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>Dorothy will have it all one
of these days&mdash;all, all," continued my cousin, still looking
at his feet.</p>
<p>After a long pause, during which Sir George took several
libations from his bowl of toddy, he cleared his throat and said,
"So Dorothy is the most beautiful girl and the richest heiress you
know?"</p>
<p>"Indeed she is," I responded, knowing full well what he was
leading up to. Realizing that in spite of me he would now speak his
mind, I made no attempt to turn the current of the
conversation.</p>
<p>After another long pause, and after several more draughts from
the bowl, my old friend and would-be benefactor said: "You may
remember a little conversation between us when you were last at
Haddon six or seven years ago, about&mdash;about Dorothy? You
remember?"</p>
<p>I, of course, dared not pretend that I had forgotten.</p>
<p>"Yes, I remember," I responded.</p>
<p>"What do you think of the proposition by this time?" asked Sir
George. "Dorothy and all she will inherit shall be
yours&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Stop, stop, Sir George!" I exclaimed. "You do not know what you
say. No one but a prince or a great peer of the realm is worthy of
aspiring to Dorothy's hand. When she is ready to marry you should
take her to London court, where she can make her choice from among
the nobles of our land. There is not a marriageable duke or earl in
England who would not eagerly seek the girl for a wife. My dear
cousin, your generosity overwhelms me, but it must not be thought
of. I am utterly unworthy of her in person, age, and position. No!
no!"</p>
<p>"But listen to me, Malcolm," responded Sir George. "Your
modesty, which, in truth, I did not know you possessed, is pleasing
to me; but I have reasons of my own for wishing that you should
marry Dorothy. I want my estates to remain in the Vernon name, and
one day <a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>you or your children
will make my house and my name noble. You and Dorothy shall go to
court, and between you&mdash;damme! if you can't win a dukedom, I
am no prophet. You would not object to change your faith, would
you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," I responded, "of course I should not object to
that."</p>
<p>"Of course not. I knew you were no fool," said Sir George. "Age!
why, you are only thirty-five years old&mdash;little more than a
matured boy. I prefer you to any man in England for Dorothy's
husband."</p>
<p>"You overwhelm me with your kindness," I returned, feeling that
I was being stranded on a very dangerous shore, amidst wealth and
beauty.</p>
<p>"Tut, tut, there's no kindness in it," returned my cousin. "I do
not offer you Dorothy's hand from an unselfish motive. I have told
you one motive, but there is another, and a little condition
besides, Malcolm." The brandy Sir George had been drinking had sent
the devil to his brain.</p>
<p>"What is the condition?" I asked, overjoyed to hear that there
was one.</p>
<p>The old man leaned toward me and a fierce blackness overclouded
his face. "I am told, Malcolm, that you have few equals in
swordsmanship, and that the duello is not new to you. Is it
true?"</p>
<p>"I believe I may say it is true," I answered. "I have fought
successfully with some of the most noted duellists of&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Enough, enough! Now, this is the condition, Malcolm,&mdash;a
welcome one to you, I am sure; a welcome one to any brave man." His
eyes gleamed with fire and hatred. "Quarrel with Rutland and his
son and kill both of them."</p>
<p>I felt like recoiling from the old fiend. I had often <a name=
"Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>quarrelled and fought, but, thank God,
never in cold blood and with deliberate intent to do murder.</p>
<p>"Then Dorothy and all I possess shall be yours," said Sir
George. "The old one will be an easy victim. The young one, they
say, prides himself on his prowess. I do not know with what cause,
I have never seen him fight. In fact, I have never seen the fellow
at all. He has lived at London court since he was a child, and has
seldom, if ever, visited this part of the country. He was a page
both to Edward VI. and to Queen Mary. Why Elizabeth keeps the
damned traitor at court to plot against her is more than I can
understand. Do the conditions suit you, Malcolm?" asked Sir George,
piercing me with his eyes.</p>
<p>I did not respond, and he continued: "All I ask is your promise
to kill Rutland and his son at the first opportunity. I care not
how. The marriage may come off at once. It can't take place too
soon to please me."</p>
<p>I could not answer for a time. The power to speak and to think
had left me. To accept Sir George's offer was out of the question.
To refuse it would be to give offence beyond reparation to my only
friend, and you know what that would have meant to me. My refuge
was Dorothy. I knew, however willing I might be or might appear to
be, Dorothy would save me the trouble and danger of refusing her
hand. So I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We have not consulted Dorothy. Perhaps her
inclinations&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Doll's inclinations be damned. I have always been kind and
indulgent to her, and she is a dutiful, obedient daughter. My wish
and command in this affair will furnish inclinations enough for
Doll."</p>
<p>"But, Sir George," I remonstrated, "I would not accept the hand
of Dorothy nor of any woman unless she desired it. I could not. I
could not."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>If Doll consents, I am to
understand that you accept?" asked Sir George.</p>
<p>I saw no way out of the dilemma, and to gain time I said, "Few
men in their right mind would refuse so flattering an offer unless
there were a most potent reason, and I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Good! good! I shall go to bed happy to-night for the first time
in years. The Rutlands will soon be out of my path."</p>
<p>There is a self-acting retribution in our evil passions which
never fails to operate. One who hates must suffer, and Sir George
for years had paid the penalty night and day, unconscious that his
pain was of his own making.</p>
<p>Before we parted I said, "This is a delicate matter, with
reference to Dorothy, and I insist that you give me time to win, if
possible, her kindly regard before you express to her your
wish."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, nonsense, Malcolm! I'll tell the girl about it in the
morning, and save you the trouble. The women will want to make some
new gowns and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But," I interrupted emphatically, "I will not have it so. It is
every man's sweet privilege to woo the woman of his choice in his
own way. It is not a trouble to me; it is a pleasure, and it is
every woman's right to be wooed by the man who seeks her. I again
insist that I only shall speak to Dorothy on this subject. At
least, I demand that I be allowed to speak first."</p>
<p>"That's all damned nonsense," responded Sir George; "but if you
will have it so, well and good. Take your own course. I suppose
it's the fashion at court. The good old country way suits me. A
girl's father tells her whom she is to marry, and, by gad, she does
it without a word and is glad to get a man. English girls obey
their parents. They know what to expect if they don't&mdash;the
lash, by God and the dungeon under the keep. Your <a name="Page_55"
id="Page_55"></a>roundabout method is all right for tenants and
peasants; but among people who possess estates and who control vast
interests, girls are&mdash;girls are&mdash;Well, they are born and
brought up to obey and to help forward the interests of their
houses." The old man was growing very drunk, and after a long pause
he continued: "Have your own way, Malcolm, but don't waste time.
Now that the matter is settled, I want to get it off my hands
quickly."</p>
<p>"I shall speak to Dorothy on the subject at the first favorable
opportunity," I responded; "but I warn you, Sir George, that if
Dorothy proves disinclined to marry me, I will not accept her
hand."</p>
<p>"Never fear for Doll; she will be all right," and we parted.</p>
<p>Doll all right! Had he only known how very far from "all right"
Dorothy was, he would have slept little that night.</p>
<p>This brings me to the other change of which I spoke&mdash;the
change in Dorothy. Change? It was a metamorphosis.</p>
<p>A fortnight after the scene at The Peacock I accidentally
discovered a drawing made by Dorothy of a man with a cigarro in his
mouth. The girl snatched the paper from my hands and blushed
convincingly.</p>
<p>"It is a caricature of&mdash;of him," she said. She smiled, and
evidently was willing to talk upon the subject of "him." I declined
the topic.</p>
<p>This happened a month or more previous to my conversation with
Sir George concerning Dorothy. A few days after my discovery of the
cigarro picture, Dorothy and I were out on the terrace together.
Frequently when she was with me she would try to lead the
conversation to the topic which I well knew was in her mind, if not
in her heart, at all times. She would speak of our first meeting
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>at The Peacock, and would use
every artifice to induce me to bring up the subject which she was
eager to discuss, but I always failed her. On the day mentioned
when we were together on the terrace, after repeated failures to
induce me to speak upon the desired topic, she said, "I suppose you
never meet&mdash;meet&mdash;him when you ride out?"</p>
<p>"Whom, Dorothy?" I asked.</p>
<p>"The gentleman with the cigarro," she responded, laughing
nervously.</p>
<p>"No," I answered, "I know nothing of him."</p>
<p>The subject was dropped.</p>
<p>At another time she said, "He was in the
village&mdash;Overhaddon&mdash;yesterday."</p>
<p>Then I knew who "him" was.</p>
<p>"How do you know?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Jennie Faxton, the farrier's daughter, told me. She often comes
to the Hall to serve me. She likes to act as my maid, and is
devoted to me."</p>
<p>"Did he send any word to you?" I asked at a venture. The girl
blushed and hung her head. "N-o," she responded.</p>
<p>"What was it, Dorothy?" I asked gently. "You may trust me."</p>
<p>"He sent no word to me," the girl responded. "Jennie said she
heard two gentlemen talking about me in front of the farrier's
shop, and one of them said something about&mdash;oh, I don't know
what it was. I can't tell you. It was all nonsense, and of course
he did not mean it."</p>
<p>"Tell me all, Dorothy," I said, seeing that she really wanted to
speak.</p>
<p>"Oh, he said something about having seen Sir George Vernon's
daughter at Rowsley, and&mdash;and&mdash;I can't tell you what he
said, I am too full of shame." If her cheeks told the truth, she
certainly was "full of shame."</p>
<p>"Tell me all, sweet cousin; I am sorry for you," I said.<a name=
"Page_57" id="Page_57"></a> She raised her eyes to mine in quick
surprise with a look of suspicion.</p>
<p>"You may trust me, Dorothy. I say it again, you may trust
me."</p>
<p>"He spoke of my beauty and called it marvellous," said the girl.
"He said that in all the world there was not another
woman&mdash;oh, I can't tell you."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, go on, Dorothy," I insisted.</p>
<p>"He said," she continued, "that he could think of nothing else
but me day or night since he had first seen me at
Rowsley&mdash;that I had bewitched him and&mdash;and&mdash;Then the
other gentleman said, 'John, don't play with fire; it will burn
you. Nothing good can come of it for you.'"</p>
<p>"Did Jennie know who the gentleman was?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No," returned Dorothy.</p>
<p>"How do you know who he was?"</p>
<p>"Jennie described him," she said.</p>
<p>"How did she describe him?" I asked.</p>
<p>"She said he was&mdash;he was the handsomest man in the world
and&mdash;and that he affected her so powerfully she fell in love
with him in spite of herself. The little devil, to dare! You see
that describes him perfectly."</p>
<p>I laughed outright, and the girl blushed painfully.</p>
<p>"It does describe him," she said petulantly. "You know it does.
No one can gainsay that he is wonderfully, dangerously handsome. I
believe the woman does not live who could refrain from feasting her
eyes on his noble beauty. I wonder if I shall ever
again&mdash;again." Tears were in her voice and almost in her
eyes.</p>
<p>"Dorothy! My God, Dorothy!" I exclaimed in terror.</p>
<p>"Yes! yes! My God, Dorothy!" she responded, covering her face
with her hands and sighing deeply, as she dropped her head and left
me.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, my God, Dorothy! The helpless iron and the <a name=
"Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>terrible loadstone! The passive seed!
The dissolving cloud and the falling rain!</p>
<p>Less than a week after the above conversation, Dorothy, Madge,
and I were riding from Yulegrave Church up to the village of
Overhaddon, which lies one mile across the hills from Haddon Hall.
My horse had cast a shoe, and we stopped at Faxton's shop to have
him shod. The town well is in the middle of an open space called by
the villagers "The Open," around which are clustered the half-dozen
houses and shops that constitute the village. The girls were
mounted, and I was standing beside them in front of the farrier's,
waiting for my horse. Jennie Faxton, a wild, unkempt girl of
sixteen, was standing in silent admiration near Dorothy. Our backs
were turned toward the well. Suddenly a light came into Jennie's
face, and she plucked Dorothy by the skirt of her habit.</p>
<p>"Look, mistress, look! Look there by the well!" said Jennie in a
whisper. Dorothy looked toward the well. I also turned my head and
beheld my friend, Sir John, holding a bucket of water for his horse
to drink. I had not seen him since we parted at The Peacock, and I
did not show that I recognized him. I feared to betray our
friendship to the villagers. They, however, did not know Sir John,
and I need not have been so cautious. But Dorothy and Madge were
with me, and of course I dared not make any demonstration of
acquaintanceship with the enemy of our house.</p>
<p>Dorothy watched John closely, and when he was ready to mount she
struck her horse with the whip, and boldly rode to the well.</p>
<p>"May I ask you to give my mare water?" she said.</p>
<p>"Certainly. Ah, I beg pardon. I did not understand," answered
Sir John, confusedly. John, the polished, self-poised courtier,
felt the confusion of a country rustic in the presence of this
wonderful girl, whose knowledge of <a name="Page_59" id=
"Page_59"></a>life had been acquired within the precincts of Haddon
Hall. Yet the inexperienced girl was self-poised and unconfused,
while the wits of the courtier, who had often calmly flattered the
queen, had all gone wool-gathering.</p>
<p>She repeated her request.</p>
<p>"Certainly," returned John, "I&mdash;I knew what you
said&mdash;but&mdash;but you surprise me."</p>
<p>"Yes," said brazen Dorothy, "I have surprised myself."</p>
<p>John, in his haste to satisfy Dolcy's thirst, dashed the water
against the skirt of Dorothy's habit, and was profuse in his
apologies.</p>
<p>"Do not mention it," said Dorothy. "I like a damp habit. The
wind cannot so easily blow it about," and she laughed as she shook
the garment to free it of the water. Dolcy refused to drink, and
Dorothy having no excuse to linger at the well, drew up her reins
and prepared to leave. While doing so, she said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Do you often come to Overhaddon?" Her eager eyes shone like red
coals, and looking at John, she awaited smilingly his response.</p>
<p>"Seldom," answered John; "not often. I mean every day&mdash;that
is, if I may come."</p>
<p>"Any one may come to the village whenever he wishes to do so,"
responded Dorothy, laughing too plainly at Sir John's confusion.
"Is it seldom, or not often, or every day that you come?" In her
overconfidence she was chaffing him. He caught the tone, and looked
quickly into the girl's eyes. Her gaze could not stand against
John's for a moment, and the long lashes drooped to shade her eyes
from the fierce light of his.</p>
<p>"I said I would come to Overhaddon every day," he returned; "and
although I must have appeared very foolish in my confusion, you
cannot misunderstand the full meaning of my words."</p>
<p><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>In John's boldness and in the
ring of his voice Dorothy felt the touch of her master, against
whom she well knew all the poor force she could muster would be
utterly helpless. She was frightened, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I must go. Good-by."</p>
<p>When she rode away from him she thought: "I believed because of
his confusion that I was the stronger. I could not stand against
him for a moment. Holy Virgin! what have I done, and to what am I
coming?"</p>
<p>You may now understand the magnitude of the task which Sir
George had set for me when he bade me marry his daughter and kill
the Rutlands. I might perform the last-named feat, but dragon
fighting would be mere child's play compared with the first, while
the girl's heart was filled with the image of another man.</p>
<p>I walked forward to meet Dorothy, leaving Madge near the
farrier's shop.</p>
<p>"Dorothy, are you mad? What have you been doing?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Could you not see?" she answered, under her breath, casting a
look of warning toward Madge and a glance of defiance at me. "Are
you, too, blind? Could you not see what I was doing?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I responded.</p>
<p>"Then why do you ask?"</p>
<p>As I went back to Madge I saw John ride out of the village by
the south road. I afterward learned that he rode gloomily back to
Rutland Castle cursing himself for a fool. His duty to his father,
which with him was a strong motive, his family pride, his self
love, his sense of caution, all told him that he was walking
open-eyed into trouble. He had tried to remain away from the
vicinity of Haddon Hall, but, despite his self-respect and
self-restraint, he had made several visits to Rowsley and to
Overhaddon, and at one time had ridden to Bakewell, <a name=
"Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>passing Haddon Hall on his way thither.
He had as much business in the moon as at Overhaddon, yet he told
Dorothy he would be at the village every day, and she, it seemed,
was only too willing to give him opportunities to transact his
momentous affairs.</p>
<p>As the floating cloud to the fathomless blue, as the seed to the
earth, as the iron to the lodestone, so was Dorothy unto John.</p>
<p>Thus you see our beautiful pitcher went to the well and was
broken.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a><a name="Page_62" id=

<h2>THE GOLDEN HEART</h2>
<p>The day after Dorothy's first meeting with Manners at Overhaddon
she was restless and nervous, and about the hour of three in the
afternoon she mounted Dolcy and rode toward Bakewell. That
direction, I was sure, she took for the purpose of misleading us at
the Hall, and I felt confident she would, when once out of sight,
head her mare straight for Overhaddon. Within an hour Dorothy was
home again, and very ill-tempered.</p>
<p>The next day she rode out in the morning. I asked her if I
should ride with her, and the emphatic "No" with which she answered
me left no room for doubt in my mind concerning her desire for my
company or her destination. Again she returned within an hour and
hurried to her apartments. Shortly afterward Madge asked me what
Dorothy was weeping about; and although in my own mind I was
confident of the cause of Dorothy's tears, I, of course, did not
give Madge a hint of my suspicion. Yet I then knew, quite as well
as I now know, that John, notwithstanding the important business
which he said would bring him to Overhaddon every day, had forced
himself to remain at home, and Dorothy, in consequence, suffered
from anger and wounded pride. She had twice ridden to Overhaddon to
meet him. She had done for his sake that which she knew she should
have left undone, <a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>and he had
refused the offering. A smarting conscience, an aching heart, and a
breast full of anger were Dorothy's rewards for her evil doing. The
day after her second futile trip to Overhaddon, I, to test her,
spoke of John. She turned upon me with the black look of a fury,
and hurled her words at me.</p>
<p>"Never again speak his despised name in my hearing. Curse him
and his whole race."</p>
<p>"Now what has he been doing?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I tell you, I will not speak of him, nor will I listen to you,"
and she dashed away from me like a fiery whirlwind.</p>
<p>Four or five days later the girl rode out again upon Dolcy. She
was away from home for four long hours, and when she returned she
was so gentle, sweet, and happy that she was willing to kiss every
one in the household from Welch, the butcher, to Sir George. She
was radiant. She clung to Madge and to me, and sang and romped
through the house like Dorothy of old.</p>
<p>Madge said, "I am so glad you are feeling better, Dorothy."
Then, speaking to me: "She has been ill for several days. She could
not sleep."</p>
<p>Dorothy looked quickly over to me, gave a little shrug to her
shoulders, bent forward her face, which was red with blushing, and
kissed Madge lingeringly upon the lips.</p>
<p>The events of Dorothy's trip I soon learned from her.</p>
<p>The little scene between Dorothy, Madge, and myself, after
Dorothy's joyful return, occurred a week before the momentous
conversation between Sir George and me concerning my union with his
house. Ten days after Sir George had offered me his daughter and
his lands, he brought up the subject again. He and I were walking
on the ridge of Bowling Green Hill.</p>
<p>"I am glad you are making such fair progress with<a name=
"Page_64" id="Page_64"></a> Doll," said Sir George. "Have you yet
spoken to her upon the subject?"</p>
<p>I was surprised to hear that I had made any progress. In fact, I
did not know that I had taken a single step. I was curious to learn
in what the progress consisted, so I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have not spoken to Dorothy yet concerning the marriage, and I
fear that I have made no progress at all. She certainly is friendly
enough to me, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I should say that the gift from you she exhibited would
indicate considerable progress," said Sir George, casting an
expressive glance toward me.</p>
<p>"What gift?" I stupidly inquired.</p>
<p>"The golden heart, you rascal. She said you told her it had
belonged to your mother."</p>
<p>"Holy Mother of Truth!" thought I, "pray give your especial care
to my cousin Dorothy. She needs it."</p>
<p>Sir George thrust at my side with his thumb and
continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Don't deny it, Malcolm. Damme, you are as shy as a boy in this
matter. But perhaps you know better than I how to go at her. I was
thinking only the other day that your course was probably the right
one. Doll, I suspect, has a dash of her old father's temper, and
she may prove a little troublesome unless we let her think she is
having her own way. Oh, there is nothing like knowing how to handle
them, Malcolm. Just let them think they are having their own way
and&mdash;and save trouble. Doll may have more of her father in her
than I suspect, and perhaps it is well for us to move slowly. You
will be able to judge, but you must not move too slowly. If in the
end she should prove stubborn, we will break her will or break her
neck. I would rather have a daughter in Bakewell churchyard than a
wilful, stubborn, disobedient huzzy in Haddon Hall."</p>
<p><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>Sir George had been drinking,
and my slip concerning the gift passed unnoticed by him.</p>
<p>"I am sure you well know how to proceed in this matter, but
don't be too cautious, Malcolm; the best woman living loves to be
stormed."</p>
<p>"Trust me," I answered, "I shall speak&mdash;" and my words
unconsciously sank away to thought, as thought often, and
inconveniently at times, grows into words.</p>
<p>"Dorothy, Dorothy," said the thoughts again and again, "where
came you by the golden heart?" and "where learned you so
villanously to lie?"</p>
<p>"From love," was the response, whispered by the sighing winds.
"From love, that makes men and women like unto gods and teaches
them the tricks of devils." "From love," murmured the dry rustling
leaves and the rugged trees. "From love," sighed the fleecy clouds
as they floated in the sweet restful azure of the vaulted sky.
"From love," cried the mighty sun as he poured his light and heat
upon the eager world to give it life. I would not give a fig for a
woman, however, who would not lie herself black in the face for the
sake of her lover, and I am glad that it is a virtue few women
lack. One who would scorn to lie under all other circumstances
would&mdash;but you understand. I suppose that Dorothy had never
before uttered a real lie. She hated all that was evil and loved
all that was good till love came a-teaching.</p>
<p>I quickly invented an excuse to leave Sir George, and returned
to the Hall to seek Dorothy. I found her and asked her to accompany
me for a few minutes that I might speak with her privately. We went
out upon the terrace and I at once began:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You should tell me when I present you gifts that I may not
cause trouble by my ignorance nor show surprise when I suddenly
learn what I have done. You see when a man gives a lady a gift and
he does not know it, he is apt to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>Holy Virgin!" exclaimed
Dorothy, pale with fear and consternation. "Did you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, I did not betray you, but I came perilously near it."</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I wanted to tell you about it. I tried several times to
do so&mdash;I did so long to tell somebody, but I could not bring
myself to speak. I was full of shame, yet I was proud and happy,
for all that happened was good and pure and sacred. You are not a
woman; you cannot know&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But I do know. I know that you saw Manners the other day, and
that he gave you a golden heart."</p>
<p>"How did you know? Did any one&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Tell me? No. I knew it when you returned after five hours'
absence, looking radiant as the sun."</p>
<p>"Oh!" the girl exclaimed, with a startled movement.</p>
<p>"I also knew," I continued, "that at other times when you rode
out upon Dolcy you had not seen him."</p>
<p>"How did you know?" she asked, with quick-coming breath.</p>
<p>"By your ill-humor," I answered.</p>
<p>"I knew it was so. I felt that everybody knew all that I had
been doing. I could almost see father and Madge and you&mdash;even
the servants&mdash;reading the wickedness written upon my heart. I
knew that I could hide it from nobody." Tears were very near the
girl's eyes.</p>
<p>"We cannot help thinking that our guilty consciences, through
which we see so plainly our own evil, are transparent to all the
world. In that fact lies an evil-doer's greatest danger," said I,
preacher fashion; "but you need have no fear. What you have done I
believe is suspected by no one save me."</p>
<p>A deep sigh of relief rose from the girl's heaving breast.</p>
<p>"Well," she began, "I will tell you all about it, and I am only
too glad to do so. It is heavy, Malcolm, <a name="Page_67" id=
"Page_67"></a>heavy on my conscience. But I would not be rid of it
for all the kingdoms of the earth."</p>
<p>"A moment since you told me that your conduct was good and pure
and sacred, and now you tell me that it is heavy on your
conscience. Does one grieve, Dorothy, for the sake of that which is
good and pure and sacred?"</p>
<p>"I cannot answer your question," she replied. "I am no priest.
But this I know: I have done no evil, and my conscience
nevertheless is sore. Solve me the riddle, Malcolm, if you
can."</p>
<p>"I cannot solve your riddle, Dorothy," I replied; "but I feel
sure it will be far safer for each of us if you will tell me all
that happens hereafter."</p>
<p>"I am sure you are right," she responded; "but some secrets are
so delicious that we love to suck their sweets alone. I believe,
however, your advice is good, and I will tell you all that has
happened, though I cannot look you in the face while doing it." She
hesitated a moment, and her face was red with tell-tale blushes.
She continued, "I have acted most unmaidenly."</p>
<p>"Unmaidenly perhaps, but not unwomanly," said I.</p>
<p>"I thank you," she said, interrupting my sentence. It probably
was well that she did so, for I was about to add, "To act womanly
often means to get yourself into mischief and your friends into as
much trouble as possible." Had I finished my remark, she would not
have thanked me.</p>
<p>"Well," said the girl, beginning her laggard narrative, "after
we saw&mdash;saw him at Overhaddon, you know, I went to the village
on each of three days&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know that also," I said.</p>
<p>"How did you&mdash;but never mind. I did not see him, and when I
returned home I felt angry and hurt and&mdash;and&mdash;but never
mind that either. One day I found him, and I at once rode to the
well where he was standing <a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>by
his horse. He drew water for Dolcy, but the perverse mare would not
drink."</p>
<p>"A characteristic of her sex," I muttered.</p>
<p>"What did you say?" asked the girl.</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>She continued: "He seemed constrained and distant in his manner,
but I knew, that is, I thought&mdash;I mean I felt&mdash;oh, you
know&mdash;he looked as if he were glad to see me and I&mdash;I,
oh, God! I was so glad and happy to see him that I could hardly
restrain myself to act at all maidenly. He must have heard my heart
beat. I thought he was in trouble. He seemed to have something he
wished to say to me."</p>
<p>"He doubtless had a great deal he wished to say to you," said I,
again tempted to futile irony.</p>
<p>"I was sure he had something to say," the girl returned
seriously. "He was in trouble. I knew that he was, and I longed to
help him."</p>
<p>"What trouble?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know. I forgot to ask, but he looked troubled."</p>
<p>"Doubtless he was troubled," I responded. "He had sufficient
cause for trouble," I finished the sentence to myself with the
words, "in you."</p>
<p>"What was the cause of his trouble?" she hastily asked, turning
her face toward me.</p>
<p>"I do not know certainly," I answered in a tone of irony which
should have pierced an oak board, while the girl listened and
looked at me eagerly; "but I might guess."</p>
<p>"What was it? What was it? Let me hear you guess," she
asked.</p>
<p>"You," I responded laconically.</p>
<p>"I!" she exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes, you," I responded with emphasis. "You would bring trouble
to any man, but to Sir John Manners&mdash;well, <a name="Page_69"
id="Page_69"></a>if he intends to keep up these meetings with you
it would be better for his peace and happiness that he should get
him a house in hell, for he would live there more happily than on
this earth."</p>
<p>"That is a foolish, senseless remark, Malcolm," the girl
replied, tossing her head with a show of anger in her eyes. "This
is no time to jest." I suppose I could not have convinced her that
I was not jesting.</p>
<p>"At first we did not speak to each other even to say good day,
but stood by the well in silence for a very long time. The village
people were staring at us, and I felt that every window had a
hundred faces in it, and every face a hundred eyes."</p>
<p>"You imagined that," said I, "because of your guilty
conscience."</p>
<p>"Perhaps so. But it seemed to me that we stood by the well in
silence a very long time. You see, Cousin Malcolm, I was not the
one who should speak first. I had done more than my part in going
to meet him."</p>
<p>"Decidedly so," said I, interrupting the interesting
narrative.</p>
<p>"When I could bear the gaze of the villagers no longer, I drew
up my reins and started to leave The Open by the north road. After
Dolcy had climbed halfway up North Hill, which as you know
overlooks the village, I turned my head and saw Sir John still
standing by the well, resting his hand upon his horse's mane. He
was watching me. I grew angry, and determined that he should follow
me, even if I had to call him. So I drew Dolcy to a stand. Was not
that bold in me? But wait, there is worse to come, Malcolm. He did
not move, but stood like a statue looking toward me. I knew that he
wanted to come, so after a little time I&mdash;I beckoned to him
and&mdash;and then he came like a thunderbolt. Oh! it was
delicious. I put Dolcy to a gallop, for when he started toward me I
was frightened.<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a> Besides I did
not want him to overtake me till we were out of the village. But
when once he had started, he did not wait. He was as swift now as
he had been slow, and my heart throbbed and triumphed because of
his eagerness, though in truth I was afraid of him. Dolcy, you
know, is very fleet, and when I touched her with the whip she soon
put half a mile between me and the village. Then I brought her to a
walk and&mdash;and he quickly overtook me.</p>
<p>"When he came up to me he said: 'I feared to follow you, though
I ardently wished to do so. I dreaded to tell you my name lest you
should hate me. Sir Malcolm at The Peacock said he would not
disclose to you my identity. I am John Manners. Our fathers are
enemies.'</p>
<p>"Then I said to him, 'That is the reason I wish to talk to you.
I wished you to come to meet me because I wanted to tell you that I
regret and deplore the feud between our fathers.'&mdash;'Ah, you
wished me to come?' he asked.&mdash;'Of course I did,' I answered,
'else why should I be here?'&mdash;'No one regrets the feud between
our houses so deeply as I,' replied Sir John. 'I can think of
nothing else by day, nor can I dream of anything else by night. It
is the greatest cause for grief and sorrow that has ever come into
my life.' You see, Cousin Malcolm," the girl continued, "I was
right. His father's conduct does trouble him. Isn't he noble and
broad-minded to see the evil of his father's ways?"</p>
<p>I did not tell the girl that Sir John's regret for the feud
between the houses of Manners and Vernon grew out of the fact that
it separated him from her; nor did I tell her that he did not
grieve over his "father's ways."</p>
<p>I asked, "Did Sir John tell you that he grieved because of his
father's ill-doing?"</p>
<p>"N-o, not in set terms, but&mdash;that, of course, would have
been very hard for him to say. I told you what he said, and there
could be no other meaning to his words."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>Of course not," I
responded.</p>
<p>"No, and I fairly longed to reach out my hand and clutch him,
because&mdash;because I was so sorry for him."</p>
<p>"Was sorrow your only feeling?" I asked.</p>
<p>The girl looked at me for a moment, and her eyes filled with
tears. Then she sobbed gently and said, "Oh, Cousin Malcolm, you
are so old and so wise." ("Thank you," thought I, "a second Daniel
come to judgment at thirty-five; or Solomon and Methuselah in
one.") She continued: "Tell me, tell me, what is this terrible
thing that has come upon me. I seem to be living in a dream. I am
burning with a fever, and a heavy weight is here upon my breast. I
cannot sleep at night. I can do nothing but long and yearn
for&mdash;for I know not what&mdash;till at times it seems that
some frightful, unseen monster is slowly drawing the heart out of
my bosom. I think of&mdash;of him at all times, and I try to recall
his face, and the tones of his voice until, Cousin Malcolm, I tell
you I am almost mad. I call upon the Holy Virgin hour by hour to
pity me; but she is pure, and cannot know what I feel. I hate and
loathe myself. To what am I coming? Where will it all end? Yet I
can do nothing to save myself. I am powerless against this terrible
feeling. I cannot even resolve to resist it. It came upon me mildly
that day at The Peacock Inn, when I first saw him, and it grows
deeper and stronger day by day, and, alas! night by night. I seem
to have lost myself. In some strange way I feel as if I had sunk
into him&mdash;that he had absorbed me."</p>
<p>"The iron, the seed, the cloud, and the rain," thought I.</p>
<p>"I believed," continued the girl, "that if he would exert his
will I might have relief; but there again I find trouble, for I
cannot bring myself to ask him to will it. The feeling within me is
like a sore heart: painful as it is, I must keep it. Without it I
fear I could not live."</p>
<p>After this outburst there was a long pause during which <a name=
"Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>she walked by my side, seemingly
unconscious that I was near her. I had known for some time that
Dorothy was interested in Manners; but I was not prepared to see
such a volcano of passion. I need not descant upon the evils and
dangers of the situation. The thought that first came to me was
that Sir George would surely kill his daughter before he would
allow her to marry a son of Rutland. I was revolving in my mind how
I should set about to mend the matter when Dorothy again spoke.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Cousin Malcolm, can a man throw a spell over a woman
and bewitch her?"</p>
<p>"I do not know. I have never heard of a man witch," I
responded.</p>
<p>"No?" asked the girl.</p>
<p>"But," I continued, "I do know that a woman may bewitch a man.
John Manners, I doubt not, could also testify knowingly on the
subject by this time."</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="v072" id="v072"></a> <img src=
"images/v072.jpg" alt="" title="" /></div>
<p>"Oh, do you think he is bewitched?" cried Dorothy, grasping my
arm and looking eagerly into my face. "If I could bewitch him, I
would do it. I would deal with the devil gladly to learn the art. I
would not care for my soul. I do not fear the future. The present
is a thousand-fold dearer to me than either the past or the future.
I care not what comes hereafter. I want him now. Ah, Malcolm, pity
my shame."</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands, and after a moment
continued: "I am not myself. I belong not to myself. But if I knew
that he also suffers, I do believe my pain would be less."</p>
<p>"I think you may set your heart at rest upon that point," I
answered. "He, doubtless, also suffers."</p>
<p>"I hope so," she responded, unconscious of the selfish wish she
had expressed. "If he does not, I know not what will be my
fate."</p>
<p>I saw that I had made a mistake in assuring her that<a name=
"Page_73" id="Page_73"></a> John also suffered, and I determined to
correct it later on, if possible.</p>
<p>Dorothy was silent, and I said, "You have not told me about the
golden heart."</p>
<p>"I will tell you," she answered. "We rode for two hours or more,
and talked of the weather and the scenery, until there was nothing
more to be said concerning either. Then Sir John told me of the
court in London, where he has always lived, and of the queen whose
hair, he says, is red, but not at all like mine. I wondered if he
would speak of the beauty of my hair, but he did not. He only
looked at it. Then he told me about the Scottish queen whom he once
met when he was on an embassy to Edinburgh. He described her
marvellous beauty, and I believe he sympathizes with her
cause&mdash;that is, with her cause in Scotland. He says she has no
good cause in England. He is true to our queen. Well&mdash;well he
talked so interestingly that I could have listened a whole
month&mdash;yes, all my life."</p>
<p>"I suppose you could," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes," she continued, "but I could not remain longer from home,
and when I left him he asked me to accept a keepsake which had
belonged to his mother, as a token that there should be no feud
between him and me." And she drew from her bosom a golden heart
studded with diamonds and pierced by a white silver arrow.</p>
<p>"I, of course, accepted it, then we said 'good-by,' and I put
Dolcy to a gallop that she might speedily take me out of
temptation."</p>
<p>"Have you ridden to Overhaddon for the purpose of seeing Manners
many times since he gave you the heart?" I queried.</p>
<p>"What would you call 'many times'?" she asked, drooping her
head.</p>
<p>"Every day?" I said interrogatively. She nodded.<a name=
"Page_74" id="Page_74"></a> "Yes. But I have seen him only once
since the day when he gave me the heart."</p>
<p>Nothing I could say would do justice to the subject, so I
remained silent.</p>
<p>"But you have not yet told me how your father came to know of
the golden heart," I said.</p>
<p>"It was this way: One morning while I was looking at the heart,
father came upon me suddenly before I could conceal it. He asked me
to tell him how I came by the jewel, and in my fright and confusion
I could think of nothing else to say, so I told him you had given
it to me. He promised not to speak to you about the heart, but he
did not keep his word. He seemed pleased."</p>
<p>"Doubtless he was pleased," said I, hoping to lead up to the
subject so near to Sir George's heart, but now farther than ever
from mine.</p>
<p>The girl unsuspectingly helped me.</p>
<p>"Father asked if you had spoken upon a subject of great interest
to him and to yourself, and I told him you had not. 'When he does
speak,' said father most kindly, 'I want you to grant his
request'&mdash;and I will grant it, Cousin Malcolm." She looked in
my face and continued: "I will grant your request, whatever it may
be. You are the dearest friend I have in the world, and mine is the
most loving and lovable father that girl ever had. It almost breaks
my heart when I think of his suffering should he learn of what I
have done&mdash;that which I just told to you." She walked beside
me meditatively for a moment and said, "To-morrow I will return Sir
John's gift and I will never see him again."</p>
<p>I felt sure that by to-morrow she would have repented of her
repentance; but I soon discovered that I had given her much more
time than she needed to perform that trifling feminine gymnastic,
for with the next breath she said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have no means of returning the heart. I must see <a name=
"Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>him once more and I will give&mdash;give
it&mdash;it&mdash;back to&mdash;to him, and will tell him that I
can see him never again." She scarcely had sufficient resolution to
finish telling her intention. Whence, then, would come the will to
put it in action? Forty thieves could not have stolen the heart
from her, though she thought she was honest when she said she would
take it to him.</p>
<p>"Dorothy," said I, seriously but kindly, "have you and Sir John
spoken of&mdash;"</p>
<p>She evidently knew that I meant to say "of love," for she
interrupted me.</p>
<p>"N-o, but surely he knows. And I&mdash;I think&mdash;at least I
hope with all my heart that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I will take the heart to Sir John," said I, interrupting her
angrily, "and you need not see him again. He has acted like a fool
and a knave. He is a villain, Dorothy, and I will tell him as much
in the most emphatic terms I have at my command."</p>
<p>"Dare you speak against him or to him upon the subject!" she
exclaimed, her eyes blazing with anger; "you&mdash;you asked for my
confidence and I gave it. You said I might trust you and I did so,
and now you show me that I am a fool indeed. Traitor!"</p>
<p>"My dear cousin," said I, seeing that she spoke the truth in
charging me with bad faith, "your secret is safe with me. I swear
it by my knighthood. You may trust me. I spoke in anger. But Sir
John has acted badly. That you cannot gainsay. You, too, have done
great evil. That also you cannot gainsay."</p>
<p>"No," said the girl, dejectedly, "I cannot deny it; but the
greatest evil is yet to come."</p>
<p>"You must do something," I continued. "You must take some
decisive step that will break this connection, and you must take
the step at once if you would save yourself from the frightful evil
that is in store for you. Forgive <a name="Page_76" id=
"Page_76"></a>me for what I said, sweet cousin. My angry words
sprang from my love for you and my fear for your future."</p>
<p>No girl's heart was more tender to the influence of kindness
than Dorothy's. No heart was more obdurate to unkindness or
peremptory command.</p>
<p>My words softened her at once, and she tried to smother the
anger I had aroused. But she did not entirely succeed, and a spark
remained which in a moment or two created a disastrous
conflagration. You shall hear.</p>
<p>She walked by my side in silence for a little time, and then
spoke in a low, slightly sullen tone which told of her effort to
smother her resentment.</p>
<p>"I do trust you, Cousin Malcolm. What is it that you wish to ask
of me? Your request is granted before it is made."</p>
<p>"Do not be too sure of that, Dorothy," I replied. "It is a
request your father ardently desires me to make, and I do not know
how to speak to you concerning the subject in the way I wish."</p>
<p>I could not ask her to marry me, and tell her with the same
breath that I did not want her for my wife. I felt I must wait for
a further opportunity to say that I spoke only because her father
had required me to do so, and that circumstances forced me to put
the burden of refusal upon her. I well knew that she would refuse
me, and then I intended to explain.</p>
<p>"Why, what is it all about?" asked the girl in surprise,
suspecting, I believe, what was to follow.</p>
<p>"It is this: your father is anxious that his vast estates shall
not pass out of the family name, and he wishes you to be my wife,
so that your children may bear the loved name of Vernon."</p>
<p>I could not have chosen a more inauspicious time to speak. She
looked at me for an instant in surprise, <a name="Page_77" id=
"Page_77"></a>turning to scorn. Then she spoke in tones of
withering contempt.</p>
<p>"Tell my father that I shall never bear a child by the name of
Vernon. I would rather go barren to my grave. Ah! that is why Sir
John Manners is a villain? That is why a decisive step should be
taken? That is why you come to my father's house a-fortune-hunting?
After you have squandered your patrimony and have spent a dissolute
youth in profligacy, after the women of the class you have known
will have no more of you but choose younger men, you who are old
enough to be my father come here and seek your fortune, as your
father sought his, by marriage. I do not believe that my father
wishes me to&mdash;to marry you. You have wheedled him into giving
his consent when he was in his cups. But even if he wished it with
all his heart, I would not marry you." Then she turned and walked
rapidly toward the Hall.</p>
<p>Her fierce words angered me; for in the light of my real
intentions her scorn was uncalled for, and her language was
insulting beyond endurance. For a moment or two the hot blood
rushed to my brain and rendered me incapable of intelligent
thought. But as Dorothy walked from me I realized that something
must be done at once to put myself right with her. When my fit of
temper had cooled, and when I considered that the girl did not know
my real intentions, I could not help acknowledging that in view of
all that had just passed between us concerning Sir John Manners,
and, in fact, in view of all that she had seen and could see, her
anger was justifiable.</p>
<p>I called to her: "Dorothy, wait a moment. You have not heard all
I have to say."</p>
<p>She hastened her pace. A few rapid strides brought me to her
side. I was provoked, not at her words, for they were almost
justifiable, but because she would <a name="Page_78" id=
"Page_78"></a>not stop to hear me. I grasped her rudely by the arm
and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Listen till I have finished."</p>
<p>"I will not," she answered viciously. "Do not touch me."</p>
<p>I still held her by the arm and said: "I do not wish to marry
you. I spoke only because your father desired me to do so, and
because my refusal to speak would have offended him beyond any
power of mine to make amends. I could not tell you that I did not
wish you for my wife until you had given me an opportunity. I was
forced to throw the burden of refusal upon you."</p>
<p>"That is but a ruse&mdash;a transparent, flimsy ruse," responded
the stubborn, angry girl, endeavoring to draw her arm from my
grasp.</p>
<p>"It is not a ruse," I answered. "If you will listen to me and
will help me by acting as I suggest, we may between us bring your
father to our way of thinking, and I may still be able to retain
his friendship."</p>
<p>"What is your great plan?" asked Dorothy, in a voice such as one
might expect to hear from a piece of ice.</p>
<p>"I have formed no plan as yet," I replied, "although I have
thought of several. Until we can determine upon one, I suggest that
you permit me to say to your father that I have asked you to be my
wife, and that the subject has come upon you so suddenly that you
wish a short time,&mdash;a fortnight or a month&mdash;in which to
consider your answer."</p>
<p>"That is but a ruse, I say, to gain time," she answered
contemptuously. "I do not wish one moment in which to consider. You
already have my answer. I should think you had had enough. Do you
desire more of the same sort? A little of such treatment should go
a long way with a man possessed of one spark of honor or
self-respect."</p>
<p>Her language would have angered a sheep.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>If you will not listen to
me," I answered, thoroughly aroused and careless of consequences,
"go to your father. Tell him I asked you to be my wife, and that
you scorned my suit. Then take the consequences. He has always been
gentle and tender to you because there has been no conflict. Cross
his desires, and you will learn a fact of which you have never
dreamed. You have seen the manner in which he treats others who
oppose him. You will learn that with you, too, he can be one of the
cruelest and most violent of men."</p>
<p>"You slander my father. I will go to him as you advise and will
tell him that I would not marry you if you wore the English crown.
I, myself, will tell him of my meeting with Sir John Manners rather
than allow you the pleasure of doing so. He will be angry, but he
will pity me."</p>
<p>"For God's sake, Dorothy, do not tell your father of your
meetings at Overhaddon. He would kill you. Have you lived in the
same house with him all these years and do you not better know his
character than to think that you may go to him with the tale you
have just told me, and that he will forgive you? Feel as you will
toward me, but believe me when I swear to you by my knighthood that
I will betray to no person what you have this day divulged to
me."</p>
<p>Dorothy made no reply, but turned from me and rapidly walked
toward the Hall. I followed at a short distance, and all my anger
was displaced by fear for her. When we reached the Hall she quickly
sought her father and approached him in her old free manner, full
of confidence in her influence over him.</p>
<p>"Father, this man"&mdash;waving her hand toward me&mdash;"has
come to Haddon Hall a-fortune-hunting. He has asked me to be his
wife, and says you wish me to accept him."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>Yes, Doll, I certainly wish
it with all my heart," returned Sir George, affectionately, taking
his daughter's hand.</p>
<p>"Then you need wish it no longer, for I will not marry him."</p>
<p>"What?" demanded her father, springing to his feet.</p>
<p>"I will not. I will not. I will not."</p>
<p>"You will if I command you to do so, you damned insolent wench,"
answered Sir George, hoarsely. Dorothy's eyes opened in wonder.</p>
<p>"Do not deceive yourself, father, for one moment," she retorted
contemptuously. "He has come here in sheep's clothing and has
adroitly laid his plans to convince you that I should marry him,
but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He has done nothing of the sort," answered Sir George, growing
more angry every moment, but endeavoring to be calm. "Nothing of
the sort. Many years ago I spoke to him on this subject, which is
very dear to my heart. The project has been dear to me ever since
you were a child. When I again broached it to Malcolm a fortnight
or more since I feared from his manner that he was averse to the
scheme. I had tried several times to speak to him about it, but he
warded me off, and when I did speak, I feared that he was not
inclined to it."</p>
<p>"Yes," interrupted the headstrong girl, apparently bent upon
destroying both of us. "He pretended that he did not wish to marry
me. He said he wished me to give a sham consent for the purpose of
gaining time till we might hit upon some plan by which we could
change your mind. He said he had no desire nor intention to marry
me. It was but a poor, lame ruse on his part."</p>
<p>During Dorothy's recital Sir George turned his face from her to
me. When she had finished speaking, he looked at me for a moment
and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Does my daughter speak the truth? Did you say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>Yes," I promptly replied, "I
have no intention of marrying your daughter." Then hoping to place
myself before Sir George in a better light, I continued: "I could
not accept the hand of a lady against her will. I told you as much
when we conversed on the subject."</p>
<p>"What?" exclaimed Sir George, furious with anger. "You too? You
whom I have befriended?"</p>
<p>"I told you, Sir George, I would not marry Dorothy without her
free consent. No gentleman of honor would accept the enforced
compliance of a woman."</p>
<p>"But Doll says that you told her you had no intention of
marrying her even should she consent," replied Sir George.</p>
<p>"I don't know that I spoke those exact words," I replied, "but
you may consider them said."</p>
<p>"You damned, ungrateful, treacherous hound!" stormed Sir George.
"You listened to me when I offered you my daughter's hand, and you
pretended to consent without at the time having any intention of
doing so."</p>
<p>"That, I suppose, is true, Sir George," said I, making a
masterful effort against anger. "That is true, for I knew that
Dorothy would not consent; and had I been inclined to the marriage,
I repeat, I would marry no woman against her will. No gentleman
would do it."</p>
<p>My remark threw Sir George into a paroxysm of rage.</p>
<p>"I did it, you cur, you dog, you&mdash;you traitorous,
ungrateful&mdash;I did it."</p>
<p>"Then, Sir George," said I, interrupting him, for I was no
longer able to restrain my anger, "you were a cowardly
poltroon."</p>
<p>"This to me in my house!" he cried, grasping a chair with which
to strike me. Dorothy came between us.</p>
<p>"Yes," said I, "and as much more as you wish to hear." I stood
my ground, and Sir George put down the chair.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>Leave my house at once," he
said in a whisper of rage.</p>
<p>"If you are on my premises in one hour from now I will have you
flogged from my door by the butcher."</p>
<p>"What have I done?" cried Dorothy. "What have I done?"</p>
<p>"Your regrets come late, Mistress Vernon," said I.</p>
<p>"She shall have more to regret," said Sir George, sullenly. "Go
to your room, you brazen, disobedient huzzy, and if you leave it
without my permission, by God, I will have you whipped till you
bleed. I will teach you to say 'I won't' when I say 'you shall.'
God curse my soul, if I don't make you repent this day!"</p>
<p>As I left the room Dorothy was in tears, and Sir George was
walking the floor in a towering rage. The girl had learned that I
was right in what I had told her concerning her father's violent
temper.</p>
<p>I went at once to my room in Eagle Tower and collected my few
belongings in a bundle. Pitifully small it was, I tell you.</p>
<p>Where I should go I knew not, and where I should remain I knew
even less, for my purse held only a few shillings&mdash;the remnant
of the money Queen Mary had sent to me by the hand of Sir Thomas
Douglas. England was as unsafe for me as Scotland; but how I might
travel to France without money, and how I might without a pass
evade Elizabeth's officers who guarded every English port, even
were I supplied with gold, were problems for which I had no
solution.</p>
<p>There were but two persons in Haddon Hall to whom I cared to say
farewell. They were Lady Madge and Will Dawson. The latter was a
Scot, and was attached to the cause of Queen Mary. He and I had
become friends, and on several occasions we had talked
confidentially over Mary's sad plight.</p>
<p>When my bundle was packed, I sought Madge and <a name="Page_83"
id="Page_83"></a>found her in the gallery near the foot of the
great staircase. She knew my step and rose to greet me with a
bright smile.</p>
<p>"I have come to say good-by to you, Cousin Madge," said I. The
smile vanished from her face.</p>
<p>"You are not going to leave Haddon Hall?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, and forever," I responded. "Sir George has ordered me to
go."</p>
<p>"No, no," she exclaimed. "I cannot believe it. I supposed that
you and my uncle were friends. What has happened? Tell me if you
can&mdash;if you wish. Let me touch your hand," and as she held out
her hands, I gladly grasped them.</p>
<p>I have never seen anything more beautiful than Madge Stanley's
hands. They were not small, but their shape, from the fair, round
forearm and wrist to the ends of the fingers was worthy of a
sculptor's dream. Beyond their physical beauty there was an
expression in them which would have belonged to her eyes had she
possessed the sense of sight. The flood of her vital energy had for
so many years been directed toward her hands as a substitute for
her lost eyesight that their sensitiveness showed itself not only
in an infinite variety of delicate gestures and movements, changing
with her changing moods, but they had an expression of their own,
such as we look for in the eyes. I had gazed upon her hands so
often, and had studied so carefully their varying expression,
discernible both to my sight and to my touch, that I could read her
mind through them as we read the emotions of others through the
countenance. The "feel" of her hands, if I may use the word, I can
in no way describe. Its effect on me was magical. The happiest
moments I have ever known were those when I held the fair blind
girl by the hand and strolled upon the great terrace or followed
the <a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>babbling winding course of
dear old Wye, and drank in the elixir of all that is good and pure
from the cup of her sweet, unconscious influence.</p>
<p>Madge, too, had found happiness in our strolling. She had also
found health and strength, and, marvellous to say, there had come
to her a slight improvement in vision. She had always been able to
distinguish sunlight from darkness, but with renewed strength had
come the power dimly to discern dark objects in a strong light, and
even that small change for the better had brought unspeakable
gladness to her heart. She said she owed it all to me. A faint pink
had spread itself in her cheeks and a plumpness had been imparted
to her form which gave to her ethereal beauty a touch of the
material. Nor was this to be regretted, for no man can adequately
make love to a woman who has too much of the angel in her. You must
not think, however, that I had been making love to Madge. On the
contrary, I again say, the thought had never entered my mind.
Neither at that time had I even suspected that she would listen to
me upon the great theme. I had in my self-analysis assigned many
reasons other than love for my tenderness toward her; but when I
was about to depart, and she impulsively gave me her hands, I,
believing that I was grasping them for the last time, felt the
conviction come upon me that she was dearer to me than all else in
life.</p>
<p>"Do you want to tell me why my uncle has driven you from
Haddon?" she asked.</p>
<p>"He wished me to ask Dorothy to be my wife," I returned.</p>
<p>"And you?" she queried.</p>
<p>"I did so."</p>
<p>Instantly the girl withdrew her hands from mine and stepped back
from me. Then I had another revelation. I knew what she meant and
felt. Her hands told me all, <a name="Page_85" id=
"Page_85"></a>even had there been no expression in her movement and
in her face.</p>
<p>"Dorothy refused," I continued, "and her father desired to force
her into compliance. I would not be a party to the transaction, and
Sir George ordered me to leave his house."</p>
<p>After a moment of painful silence Madge said:&mdash;"I do not
wonder that you should wish to marry Dorothy. She&mdash;she must be
very beautiful."</p>
<p>"I do not wish to marry Dorothy," said I. I heard a slight noise
back of me, but gave it no heed. "And I should not have married her
had she consented. I knew that Dorothy would refuse me, therefore I
promised Sir George that I would ask her to be my wife. Sir George
had always been my friend, and should I refuse to comply with his
wishes, I well knew he would be my enemy. He is bitterly angry
against me now; but when he becomes calm, he will see wherein he
has wronged me. I asked Dorothy to help me, but she would not
listen to my plan."</p>
<p>"&mdash;and now she begs your forgiveness," cried Dorothy, as
she ran weeping to me, and took my hand most humbly.</p>
<p>"Dorothy! Dorothy!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"What frightful evil have I brought upon you?" said she. "Where
can you go? What will you do?"</p>
<p>"I know not," I answered. "I shall probably go to the Tower of
London when Queen Elizabeth's officers learn of my quarrel with Sir
George. But I will try to escape to France."</p>
<p>"Have you money?" asked Madge, tightly holding one of my
hands.</p>
<p>"A small sum," I answered.</p>
<p>"How much have you? Tell me. Tell me how much have you,"
insisted Madge, clinging to my hand and speaking with a force that
would brook no refusal.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>A very little sum, I am
sorry to say; only a few shillings," I responded.</p>
<p>She quickly withdrew her hand from mine and began to remove the
baubles from her ears and the brooch from her throat. Then she
nervously stripped the rings from her fingers and held out the
little handful of jewels toward me, groping for my hands.</p>
<p>"Take these, Malcolm. Take these, and wait here till I return."
She turned toward the staircase, but in her confusion she missed
it, and before I could reach her, she struck against the great
newel post.</p>
<p>"God pity me," she said, as I took her hand. "I wish I were
dead. Please lead me to the staircase, Cousin Malcolm. Thank
you."</p>
<p>She was weeping gently when she started up the steps, and I knew
that she was going to fetch me her little treasure of gold.</p>
<p>Madge held up the skirt of her gown with one hand while she
grasped the banister with the other. She was halfway up when
Dorothy, whose generous impulses needed only to be prompted, ran
nimbly and was about to pass her on the staircase when Madge
grasped her gown.</p>
<p>"Please don't, Dorothy. Please do not. I beg you, do not
forestall me. Let me do this. Let me. You have all else to make you
happy. Don't take this from me only because you can see and can
walk faster than I."</p>
<p>Dorothy did not stop, but hurried past her. Madge sank upon the
steps and covered her face with her hands. Then she came gropingly
back to me just as Dorothy returned.</p>
<p>"Take these, Cousin Malcolm," cried Dorothy. "Here are a few
stones of great value. They belonged to my mother."</p>
<p>Madge was sitting dejectedly upon the lowest step of <a name=
"Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>the staircase. Dorothy held her
jewel-box toward me, and in the midst of the diamonds and gold I
saw the heart John Manners had given her. I did not take the
box.</p>
<p>"Do you offer me this, too&mdash;even this?" I said, lifting the
heart from the box by its chain.&mdash;"Yes, yes," cried Dorothy,
"even that, gladly, gladly." I replaced it in the box.</p>
<p>Then spoke Madge, while she tried to check the falling
tears:&mdash;"Dorothy, you are a cruel, selfish girl."</p>
<p>"Oh, Madge," cried Dorothy, stepping to her side and taking her
hand. "How can you speak so unkindly to me?"</p>
<p>"You have everything good," interrupted Madge. "You have beauty,
wealth, eyesight, and yet you would not leave to me the joy of
helping him. I could not see, and you hurried past me that you
might be first to give him the help of which I was the first to
think."</p>
<p>Dorothy was surprised at the outburst from Madge, and kneeled by
her side.</p>
<p>"We may both help Cousin Malcolm," she said.</p>
<p>"No, no," responded Madge, angrily. "Your jewels are more than
enough. He would have no need of my poor offering."</p>
<p>I took Madge's hand and said, "I shall accept help from no one
but you, Madge; from no one but you."</p>
<p>"I will go to our rooms for your box," said Dorothy, who had
begun to see the trouble. "I will fetch it for you."</p>
<p>"No, I will fetch it," answered Madge. She arose, and I led her
to the foot of the staircase. When she returned she held in her
hands a purse and a little box of jewels. These she offered to me,
but I took only the purse, saying: "I accept the purse. It contains
more money than I shall need. From its weight I should say there
are twenty gold pounds sterling."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>Twenty-five," answered
Madge. "I have saved them, believing that the time might come when
they would be of great use to me. I did not know the joy I was
saving for myself."</p>
<p>Tears came to my eyes, and Dorothy wept silently.</p>
<p>"Will you not take the jewels also?" asked Madge.</p>
<p>"No," I responded; "the purse will more than pay my expenses to
France, where I have wealthy relatives. There I may have my
mother's estate for the asking, and I can repay you the gold. I can
never repay your kindness."</p>
<p>"I hope you will never offer to repay the gold," said Madge.</p>
<p>"I will not," I gladly answered.</p>
<p>"As to the kindness," she said, "you have paid me in advance for
that many, many times over."</p>
<p>I then said farewell, promising to send letters telling of my
fortune. As I was leaving I bent forward and kissed Madge upon the
forehead, while she gently pressed my hand, but did not speak a
word.</p>
<p>"Cousin Malcolm," said Dorothy, who held my other hand, "you are
a strong, gentle, noble man, and I want you to say that you forgive
me."</p>
<p>"I do forgive you, Dorothy, from my heart. I could not blame you
if I wished to do so, for you did not know what you were
doing."</p>
<p>"Not to know is sometimes the greatest of sins," answered
Dorothy. I bent forward to kiss her cheek in token of my full
forgiveness, but she gave me her lips and said: "I shall never
again be guilty of not knowing that you are good and true and
noble, Cousin Malcolm, and I shall never again doubt your wisdom or
your good faith when you speak to me." She did doubt me afterward,
but I fear her doubt was with good cause. I shall tell you of it in
the proper place.</p>
<p><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>Then I forced myself to leave
my fair friends and went to the gateway under Eagle Tower, where I
found Will Dawson waiting for me with my horse.</p>
<p>"Sir George ordered me to bring your horse," said Will. "He
seemed much excited. Has anything disagreeable happened? Are you
leaving us? I see you wear your steel cap and breastplate and are
carrying your bundle."</p>
<p>"Yes, Will, your master has quarrelled with me and I must leave
his house."</p>
<p>"But where do you go, Sir Malcolm? You remember that of which we
talked? In England no place but Haddon Hall will be safe for you,
and the ports are so closely guarded that you will certainly be
arrested if you try to sail for France."</p>
<p>"I know all that only too well, Will. But I must go, and I will
try to escape to France. If you wish to communicate with me, I may
be found by addressing a letter in care of the Duc de Guise."</p>
<p>"If I can ever be of help to you," said Will, "personally, or in
that other matter, Queen Mary, you understand,&mdash;you have only
to call on me."</p>
<p>"I thank you, Will," I returned, "I shall probably accept your
kind offer sooner than you anticipate. Do you know Jennie Faxton,
the ferrier's daughter?"</p>
<p>"I do," he responded.</p>
<p>"I believe she may be trusted," I said.</p>
<p>"Indeed, I believe she is true as any steel in her father's
shop," Will responded.</p>
<p>"Good-by, Will, you may hear from me soon."</p>
<p>I mounted and rode back of the terrace, taking my way along the
Wye toward Rowsley. When I turned and looked back, I saw Dorothy
standing upon the terrace. By her side, dressed in white, stood
Madge. Her hand was covering her eyes. A step or two below them on
the <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>terrace staircase stood Will
Dawson. They were three stanch friends, although one of them had
brought my troubles upon me. After all, I was leaving Haddon Hall
well garrisoned. My heart also was well garrisoned with a faithful
troop of pain. But I shall write no more of that time. It was too
full of bitterness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a><a name="Page_91" id=
"Page_91"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h2>MINE ENEMY'S ROOF-TREE</h2>
<p>I rode down the Wye to Rowsley, and by the will of my horse
rather than by any intention of my own took the road up through
Lathkil Dale. I had determined if possible to reach the city of
Chester, and thence to ride down into Wales, hoping to find on the
rough Welsh coast a fishing boat or a smuggler's craft that would
carry me to France. In truth, I cared little whether I went to the
Tower or to France, since in either case I felt that I had looked
my last upon Haddon Hall, and had spoken farewell to the only
person in all the world for whom I really cared. My ride from
Haddon gave me time for deliberate thought, and I fully agreed with
myself upon two propositions. First, I became thoroughly conscious
of my real feeling toward Madge, and secondly, I was convinced that
her kindness and her peculiar attitude toward me when I parted from
her were but the promptings of a tender heart stirred by pity for
my unfortunate situation, rather than what I thought when I said
farewell to her. The sweet Wye and the beautiful Lathkil whispered
to me as I rode beside their banks, but in their murmurings I heard
only the music of her voice. The sun shone brightly, but its
blessed light only served to remind me of the beautiful girl whom I
had left in darkness. The light were worthless to me if I could not
share it with her. What a mooning lout was I!</p>
<p><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>All my life I had been a
philosopher, and as I rode from Haddon, beneath all my gloominess
there ran a current of amusement which brought to my lips an
ill-formed, half-born laugh when I thought of the plight and
condition in which I, by candid self-communion, found myself. Five
years before that time I had left France, and had cast behind me
all the fair possibilities for noble achievement which were offered
to me in that land, that I might follow the fortunes of a woman
whom I thought I loved. Before my exile from her side I had begun
to fear that my idol was but a thing of stone; and now that I had
learned to know myself, and to see her as she really was, I
realized that I had been worshipping naught but clay for lo, these
many years. There was only this consolation in the thought for me:
every man at some time in his life is a fool&mdash;made such by a
woman. It is given to but few men to have for their fool-maker the
rightful queen of three kingdoms. All that was left to me of my
life of devotion was a shame-faced pride in the quality of my
fool-maker. "Then," thought I, "I have at last turned to be my own
fool-maker." But I suppose it had been written in the book of fate
that I should ride from Haddon a lovelorn youth of thirty-five, and
I certainly was fulfilling my destiny to the letter.</p>
<p>I continued to ride up the Lathkil until I came to a fork in the
road. One branch led to the northwest, the other toward the
southwest. I was at a loss which direction to take, and I left the
choice to my horse, in whose wisdom and judgement I had more
confidence than in my own. My horse, refusing the responsibility,
stopped. So there we stood like an equestrian statue arguing with
itself until I saw a horseman riding toward me from the direction
of Overhaddon. When he approached I recognized Sir John Manners. He
looked as woebegone as I felt, and I could not help laughing at the
pair of us, for I knew that his <a name="Page_93" id=
"Page_93"></a>trouble was akin to mine. The pain of love is
ludicrous to all save those who feel it. Even to them it is
laughable in others. A love-full heart has no room for that sort of
charity which pities for kinship's sake.</p>
<p>"What is the trouble with you, Sir John, that you look so
downcast?" said I, offering my hand.</p>
<p>"Ah," he answered, forcing a poor look of cheerfulness into his
face, "Sir Malcolm, I am glad to see you. Do I look downcast?"</p>
<p>"As forlorn as a lover who has missed seeing his sweetheart," I
responded, guessing the cause of Sir John's despondency.</p>
<p>"I have no sweetheart, therefore missing her could not have made
me downcast," he replied.</p>
<p>"So you really did miss her?" I queried. "She was detained at
Haddon Hall, Sir John, to bid me farewell."</p>
<p>"I do not understand&mdash;" began Sir John, growing cold in his
bearing.</p>
<p>"I understand quite well," I answered. "Dorothy told me all
to-day. You need keep nothing from me. The golden heart brought her
into trouble, and made mischief for me of which I cannot see the
end. I will tell you the story while we ride. I am seeking my way
to Chester, that I may, if possible, sail for France. This fork in
the road has brought me to a standstill, and my horse refuses to
decide which route we shall take. Perhaps you will direct us."</p>
<p>"Gladly. The road to the southwest&mdash;the one I shall
take&mdash;is the most direct route to Chester. But tell me, how
comes it that you are leaving Haddon Hall? I thought you had gone
there to marry-" He stopped speaking, and a smile stole into his
eyes.</p>
<p>"Let us ride forward together, and I will tell you about it,"
said I.</p>
<p>While we travelled I told Sir John the circumstances of my
departure from Haddon Hall, concealing nothing save <a name=
"Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>that which touched Madge Stanley. I then
spoke of my dangerous position in England, and told him of my great
desire to reach my mother's people in France.</p>
<p>"You will find difficulty and danger in escaping to France at
this time," said Sir John, "the guard at the ports is very strong
and strict, and your greatest risk will be at the moment when you
try to embark without a passport."</p>
<p>"That is true," I responded; "but I know of nothing else that I
can do."</p>
<p>"Come with me to Rutland Castle," said Sir John. "You may there
find refuge until such time as you can go to France. I will gladly
furnish you money which you may repay at your pleasure, and I may
soon be able to procure a passport for you."</p>
<p>I thanked him, but said I did not see my way clear to accept his
kind offer.</p>
<p>"You are unknown in the neighborhood of Rutland," he continued,
"and you may easily remain incognito." Although his offer was
greatly to my liking, I suggested several objections, chief among
which was the distaste Lord Rutland might feel toward one of my
name. I would not, of course, consent that my identity should be
concealed from him. But to be brief&mdash;an almost impossible
achievement for me, it seems&mdash;Sir John assured me of his
father's welcome, and it was arranged between us that I should take
my baptismal name, Fran&ccedil;ois de Lorraine, and passing for a
French gentleman on a visit to England, should go to Rutland with
my friend. So it happened through the strange workings of fate that
I found help and refuge under my enemy's roof-tree.</p>
<p>Kind old Lord Rutland welcomed me, as his son had foretold, and
I was convinced ere I had passed an hour under his roof that the
feud between him and Sir George was of the latter's brewing.</p>
<p>The happenings in Haddon Hall while I lived at Rutland<a name=
"Page_95" id="Page_95"></a> I knew, of course, only by the mouth of
others; but for convenience in telling I shall speak of them as if
I had seen and heard all that took place. I may now say once for
all that I shall take that liberty throughout this entire
history.</p>
<p>On the morning of the day after my departure from Haddon, Jennie
Faxton went to visit Dorothy and gave her a piece of information,
small in itself, but large in its effect upon that ardent young
lady. Will Fletcher, the arrow-maker at Overhaddon, had observed
Dorothy's movements in connection with Manners; and although
Fletcher did not know who Sir John was, that fact added to his
curiosity and righteous indignation.</p>
<p>"It do be right that some one should tell the King of the Peak
as how his daughter is carrying on with a young man who does come
here every day or two to meet her, and I do intend to tell Sir
George if she put not a stop to it," said Fletcher to some of his
gossips in Yulegrave churchyard one Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Dorothy notified John, Jennie being the messenger, of Will's
observations, visual and verbal, and designated another place for
meeting,&mdash;the gate east of Bowling Green Hill. This gate was
part of a wall on the east side of the Haddon estates adjoining the
lands of the house of Devonshire which lay to the eastward. It was
a secluded spot in the heart of the forest half a mile distant from
Haddon Hall.</p>
<p>Sir George, for a fortnight or more after my disappearance,
enforced his decree of imprisonment against Dorothy, and she, being
unable to leave the Hall, could not go to Bowling Green Gate to
meet Sir John. Before I had learned of the new trysting-place John
had ridden thither several evenings to meet Dorothy, but had found
only Jennie bearing her mistress's excuses. I supposed his
journeyings had been to Overhaddon; but I did not press his
confidence, nor did he give it.</p>
<p><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>Sir George's treatment of
Dorothy had taught her that the citadel of her father's wrath could
be stormed only by gentleness, and an opportunity was soon
presented in which she used that effective engine of feminine
warfare to her great advantage.</p>
<p>As I have told you, Sir George was very rich. No man, either
noble or gentle, in Derbyshire or in any of the adjoining counties,
possessed so great an estate or so beautiful a hall as did he. In
France we would have called Haddon Hall a grand ch&acirc;teau.</p>
<p>Sir George's deceased wife had been a sister to the Earl of
Derby, who lived at the time of which I am now writing. The earl
had a son, James, who was heir to the title and to the estates of
his father. The son was a dissipated, rustic clown&mdash;almost a
simpleton. He had the vulgarity of a stable boy and the vices of a
courtier. His associates were chosen from the ranks of gamesters,
ruffians, and tavern maids. Still, he was a scion of one of the
greatest families of England's nobility.</p>
<p>After Sir George's trouble with Dorothy, growing out of his
desire that I should wed her, the King of the Peak had begun to
feel that in his beautiful daughter he had upon his hands a
commodity that might at any time cause him trouble. He therefore
determined to marry her to some eligible gentleman as quickly as
possible, and to place the heavy responsibility of managing her in
the hands of a husband. The stubborn violence of Sir George's
nature, the rough side of which had never before been shown to
Dorothy, in her became adroit wilfulness of a quality that no
masculine mind may compass. But her life had been so entirely
undisturbed by opposing influences that her father, firm in the
belief that no one in his household would dare to thwart his will,
had remained in dangerous ignorance of the latent trouble which
pervaded his daughter from the soles of her shapely feet to the top
of her glory-crowned head.</p>
<p><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>Sir George, in casting about
for a son-in-law, had hit upon the heir to the house of Derby as a
suitable match for his child, and had entered into an alliance
offensive and defensive with the earl against the common enemy,
Dorothy. The two fathers had partly agreed that the heir to Derby
should wed the heiress of Haddon. The heir, although he had never
seen his cousin except when she was a plain, unattractive girl, was
entirely willing for the match, but the heiress&mdash;well, she had
not been consulted, and everybody connected with the affair
instinctively knew there would be trouble in that quarter. Sir
George, however, had determined that Dorothy should do her part in
case the contract of marriage should be agreed upon between the
heads of the houses. He had fully resolved to assert the majesty of
the law vested in him as a father and to compel Dorothy to do his
bidding, if there were efficacy in force and chastisement. At the
time when Sir George spoke to Dorothy about the Derby marriage, she
had been a prisoner for a fortnight or more, and had learned that
her only hope against her father lay in cunning. So she wept, and
begged for time in which to consider the answer she would give to
Lord Derby's request. She begged for two months, or even one month,
in which to bring herself to accede to her father's commands.</p>
<p>"You have always been so kind and good to me, father, that I
shall try to obey if you and the earl eventually agree upon terms,"
she said tearfully, having no intention whatever of trying to do
anything but disobey.</p>
<p>"Try!" stormed Sir George. "Try to obey me! By God, girl, I say
you shall obey!"</p>
<p>"Oh, father, I am so young. I have not seen my cousin for years.
I do not want to leave you, and I have never thought twice of any
man. Do not drive me from you."</p>
<p>Sir George, eager to crush in the outset any disposition
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>to oppose his will, grew violent
and threatened his daughter with dire punishment if she were not
docile and obedient.</p>
<p>Then said rare Dorothy:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It would indeed be a great match." Greater than ever will
happen, she thought. "I should be a countess." She strutted across
the room with head up and with dilating nostrils. The truth was,
she desired to gain her liberty once more that she might go to
John, and was ready to promise anything to achieve that end. "What
sort of a countess would I make, father?"</p>
<p>"A glorious countess, Doll, a glorious countess," said her
father, laughing. "You are a good girl to obey me so readily."</p>
<p>"Oh, but I have not obeyed you yet," returned Dorothy, fearing
that her father might be suspicious of a too ready
acquiescence.</p>
<p>"But you will obey me," answered Sir George, half in command and
half in entreaty.</p>
<p>"There are not many girls who would refuse the coronet of a
countess." She then seated herself upon her father's knee and
kissed him, while Sir George laughed softly over his easy
victory.</p>
<p>Blessed is the man who does not know when he is beaten.</p>
<p>Seeing her father's kindly humor, Dorothy said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Father, do you still wish me to remain a prisoner in my
rooms?"</p>
<p>"If you promise to be a good, obedient daughter," returned Sir
George, "you shall have your liberty."</p>
<p>"I have always been that, father, and I am too old to learn
otherwise," answered this girl, whose father had taught her
deception by his violence. You may drive men, but you cannot drive
any woman who is worth possessing. You may for a time think you
drive her, but in the end she will have her way.</p>
<p><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>Dorothy's first act of
obedience after regaining liberty was to send a letter to Manners
by the hand of Jennie Faxton.</p>
<p>John received the letter in the evening, and all next day he
passed the time whistling, singing, and looking now and again at
his horologue. He walked about the castle like a happy wolf in a
pen. He did not tell me there was a project on foot, with Dorothy
as the objective, but I knew it, and waited with some impatience
for the outcome.</p>
<p>Long before the appointed time, which was sunset, John galloped
forth for Bowling Green Gate with joy and anticipation in his heart
and pain in his conscience. As he rode, he resolved again and again
that the interview toward which he was hastening should be the last
he would have with Dorothy. But when he pictured the girl to
himself, and thought upon her marvellous beauty and infinite
winsomeness, his conscience was drowned in his longing, and he
resolved that he would postpone resolving until the morrow.</p>
<p>John hitched his horse near the gate and stood looking between
the massive iron bars toward Haddon Hall, whose turrets could be
seen through the leafless boughs of the trees. The sun was sinking
perilously low, thought John, and with each moment his heart also
sank, while his good resolutions showed the flimsy fibre of their
fabric and were rent asunder by the fear that she might not come.
As the moments dragged on and she did not come, a hundred alarms
tormented him. First among these was a dread that she might have
made resolves such as had sprung up so plenteously in him, and that
she might have been strong enough to act upon them and to remain at
home. But he was mistaken in the girl. Such resolutions as he had
been making and breaking had never come to her at all. The
difference between the man and the woman was this: he resolved in
his mind not to see her and failed in keeping to <a name="Page_100"
id="Page_100"></a>his resolution; while she resolved in her heart
to see him&mdash;resolved that nothing in heaven or earth or the
other place could keep her from seeing him, and succeeded in
carrying out her resolution. The intuitive resolve, the one that
does not know it is a resolution, is the sort before which
obstacles fall like corn before the sickle.</p>
<p>After John had waited a weary time, the form of the girl
appeared above the crest of the hill. She was holding up the skirt
of her gown, and glided over the earth so rapidly that she appeared
to be running. Beat! beat! oh, heart of John, if there is aught in
womanhood to make you throb; if there is aught in infinite grace
and winsomeness; if there is aught in perfect harmony of color and
form and movement; if there is aught of beauty, in God's power to
create that can set you pulsing, beat! for the fairest creature of
His hand is hastening to greet you. The wind had dishevelled her
hair and it was blowing in fluffy curls of golden red about her
face. Her cheeks were slightly flushed with joy and exercise, her
red lips were parted, and her eyes&mdash;but I am wasting words. As
for John's heart it almost smothered him with its beating. He had
never before supposed that he could experience such violent
throbbing within his breast and live. But at last she was at the
gate, in all her exquisite beauty and winsomeness, and something
must be done to make the heart conform to the usages of good
society. She, too, was in trouble with her breathing, but John
thought that her trouble was owing to exertion. However that may
have been, nothing in heaven or earth was ever so beautiful, so
radiant, so graceful, or so fair as this girl who had come to give
herself to John. It seems that I cannot take myself away from the
attractive theme.</p>
<p>"Ah, Sir John, you did come," said the girl, joyously.</p>
<p>"Yes," John succeeded in replying, after an effort, "and
you&mdash;I thank you, gracious lady, for coming. I do not <a name=
"Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>deserve&mdash;" the heart again
asserted itself, and Dorothy stood by the gate with downcast eyes,
waiting to learn what it was that John did not deserve. She thought
he deserved everything good.</p>
<p>"I fear I have caused you fatigue," said John, again thinking,
and with good reason, that he was a fool.</p>
<p>The English language, which he had always supposed to be his
mother tongue, had deserted him as if it were his step-mother.
After all, the difficulty, as John subsequently said, was that
Dorothy's beauty had deprived him of the power to think. He could
only see. He was entirely disorganized by a girl whom he could have
carried away in his arms.</p>
<p>"I feel no fatigue," replied Dorothy.</p>
<p>"I feared that in climbing the hill you had lost your breath,"
answered disorganized John.</p>
<p>"So I did," she returned. Then she gave a great sigh and said,
"Now I am all right again."</p>
<p>All right? So is the morning sun, so is the arching rainbow, and
so are the flitting lights of the north in midwinter. All are "all
right" because God made them, as He made Dorothy, perfect, each
after its kind.</p>
<p>A long, uneasy pause ensued. Dorothy felt the embarrassing
silence less than John, and could have helped him greatly had she
wished to do so. But she had made the advances at their former
meetings, and as she had told me, she "had done a great deal more
than her part in going to meet him." Therefore she determined that
he should do his own wooing thenceforward. She had graciously given
him all the opportunity he had any right to ask.</p>
<p>While journeying to Bowling Green Gate, John had formulated many
true and beautiful sentiments of a personal nature which he
intended expressing to Dorothy; but when the opportunity came for
him to speak, the weather, his horse, Dorothy's mare Dolcy, the
queens of England and<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a> Scotland
were the only subjects on which he could induce his tongue to
perform, even moderately well.</p>
<p>Dorothy listened attentively while John on the opposite side of
the gate discoursed limpingly on the above-named themes; and
although in former interviews she had found those topics quite
interesting, upon that occasion she had come to Bowling Green Gate
to listen to something else and was piqued not to hear it. After
ten or fifteen minutes she said demurely:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I may not remain here longer. I shall be missed at the Hall. I
regained my liberty but yesterday, and father will be suspicious of
me during the next few days. I must be watchful and must have a
care of my behavior."</p>
<p>John summoned his wits and might have spoken his mind freely had
he not feared to say too much. Despite Dorothy's witchery, honor,
conscience, and prudence still bore weight with him, and they all
dictated that he should cling to the shreds of his resolution and
not allow matters to go too far between him and this fascinating
girl. He was much in love with her; but Dorothy had reached at a
bound a height to which he was still climbing. Soon John, also, was
to reach the pinnacle whence honor, conscience, and prudence were
to be banished.</p>
<p>"I fear I must now leave you," said Dorothy, as darkness began
to gather.</p>
<p>"I hope I may soon see you again," said John.</p>
<p>"Sometime I will see you if&mdash;if I can," she answered with
downcast eyes. "It is seldom I can leave the Hall alone, but I
shall try to come here at sunset some future day." John's silence
upon a certain theme had given offence.</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you how greatly I thank you," cried John.</p>
<p>"I will say adieu," said Dorothy, as she offered him her hand
through the bars of the gate. John raised the hand gallantly to his
lips, and when she had withdrawn it there <a name="Page_103" id=
"Page_103"></a>seemed no reason for her to remain. But she stood
for a moment hesitatingly. Then she stooped to reach into her
pocket while she daintily lifted the skirt of her gown with the
other hand and from the pocket drew forth a great iron key.</p>
<p>"I brought this key, thinking that you might wish to unlock the
gate&mdash;and come to&mdash;to this side. I had great difficulty
in taking it from the forester's closet, where it has been hanging
for a hundred years or more."</p>
<p>She showed John the key, returned it to her pocket, made a
courtesy, and moved slowly away, walking backward.</p>
<p>"Mistress Vernon," cried John, "I beg you to let me have the
key."</p>
<p>"It is too late, now," said the girl, with downcast eyes.
"Darkness is rapidly falling, and I must return to the Hall."</p>
<p>John began to climb the gate, but she stopped him. He had thrown
away his opportunity.</p>
<p>"Please do not follow me, Sir John," said she, still moving
backward. "I must not remain longer."</p>
<p>"Only for one moment," pleaded John.</p>
<p>"No," the girl responded, "I&mdash;I may, perhaps, bring the key
when I come again. I am glad, Sir John, that you came to meet me
this evening." She courtesied, and then hurried away toward Haddon
Hall. Twice she looked backward and waved her hand, and John stood
watching her through the bars till her form was lost to view
beneath the crest of Bowling Green Hill.</p>
<p>"'I brought this key, thinking that you might wish to unlock the
gate and come to this side,'" muttered John, quoting the girl's
words. "Compared with you, John Manners, there is no other fool in
this world." Then meditatively: "I wonder if she feels toward me as
I feel toward her? Surely she does. What other reason could bring
her here to meet me unless she is a brazen, wanton creature who is
for every man." Then came a jealous <a name="Page_104" id=
"Page_104"></a>thought that hurt him like the piercing of a knife.
It lasted but a moment, however, and he continued muttering to
himself: "If she loves me and will be my wife, I will&mdash;I will
... In God's name what will I do? If I were to marry her, old
Vernon would kill her, and I&mdash;I should kill my father."</p>
<p>Then John mounted his horse and rode homeward the unhappiest
happy man in England. He had made perilous strides toward that
pinnacle sans honor, sans caution, sans conscience, sans everything
but love.</p>
<p>That evening while we were walking on the battlements, smoking,
John told me of his interview with Dorothy and extolled her beauty,
grace, and winsomeness which, in truth, as you know, were
matchless. But when he spoke of "her sweet, shy modesty," I came
near to laughing in his face.</p>
<p>"Did she not write a letter asking you to meet her?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;y-e-s," returned John.</p>
<p>"And," I continued, "has she not from the first sought you?"</p>
<p>"It almost seems to be so," answered John, "but notwithstanding
the fact that one might say&mdash;might call&mdash;that one might
feel that her conduct is&mdash;that it might be&mdash;you know,
well&mdash;it might be called by some persons not knowing all the
facts in the case, immodest&mdash;I hate to use the word with
reference to her&mdash;yet it does not appear to me to have been at
all immodest in Mistress Vernon, and, Sir Malcolm, I should be
deeply offended were any of my friends to intimate&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Now, John," I returned, laughing at him, "you could not, if you
wished, make me quarrel with you; and if you desire it, I will
freely avow my firm belief in the fact that my cousin Dorothy is
the flower of modesty. Does that better suit you?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>I could easily see that my
bantering words did not suit him at all; but I laughed at him, and
he could not find it in his heart to show his ill-feeling.</p>
<p>"I will not quarrel with you," he returned; "but in plain words,
I do not like the tone in which you speak of her. It hurts me, and
I do not believe you would wilfully give me pain."</p>
<p>"Indeed, I would not," I answered seriously.</p>
<p>"Mistress Vernon's conduct toward me," John continued, "has been
gracious. There has been no immodesty nor boldness in it."</p>
<p>I laughed again and said: "I make my humble apologies to her
Majesty, Queen Dorothy. But in all earnestness, Sir John, you are
right: Dorothy is modest and pure. As for her conduct toward you,
there is a royal quality about beauty such as my cousin possesses
which gives an air of graciousness to acts that in a plainer girl
would seem bold. Beauty, like royalty, has its own
prerogatives."</p>
<p>For a fortnight after the adventures just related, John, in
pursuance of his oft-repeated resolution not to see Dorothy, rode
every evening to Bowling Green Gate; but during that time he failed
to see her, and the resolutions, with each failure, became weaker
and fewer.</p>
<p>One evening, after many disappointments, John came to my room
bearing in his hands a letter which he said Jennie Faxton had
delivered to him at Bowling Green Gate.</p>
<p>"Mistress Vernon," said John, "and Lady Madge Stanley will ride
to Derby-town to-morrow. They will go in the Haddon Hall coach, and
Dawson will drive. Mistress Vernon writes to me thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"'To SIR JOHN MANNERS:&mdash;</p>
<p>"'My good wishes and my kind greeting. Lady Madge Stanley, my
good aunt, Lady Crawford, and myself do intend journeying to
Derby-town to-morrow. My aunt,<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>
Lady Crawford, is slightly ill, and although I should much regret
to see her sickness grow greater, yet if ill she must be, I do hope
that her worst day will be upon the morrow, in which case she could
not accompany Lady Madge and me. I shall nurse my good aunt
carefully this day, and shall importune her to take plentifully of
physic that she may quickly recover her health&mdash;after
to-morrow. Should a gentleman ask of Will Dawson, who will be in
the tap-room of the Royal Arms at eleven o'clock of the morning,
Dawson will be glad to inform the gentleman concerning Lady
Crawford's health. Let us hope that the physic will cure Lady
Crawford&mdash;by the day after to-morrow at furthest. The said
Will Dawson may be trusted. With great respect,</p>
<p>DOROTHY VERNON.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I suppose the gentleman will be solicitous concerning Lady
Crawford's health to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock," said I.</p>
<p>"The gentleman is now solicitous concerning Lady Crawford's
health," answered John, laughingly. "Was there ever a lady more
fair and gracious than Mistress Vernon?"</p>
<p>I smiled with a superior air at John's weakness, being, as you
know, entirely free from his complaint myself, and John
continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Perhaps you would call Mistress Dorothy bold for sending me
this letter?"</p>
<p>"It is redolent with shyness," I answered. "But would you really
wish poor Lady Crawford to be ill that you might witness Mistress
Dorothy's modesty?"</p>
<p>"Please don't jest on that subject," said John, seriously. "I
would wish anything, I fear, that would bring me an opportunity to
see her, to look upon her face, and to hear her voice. For her I
believe I would sacrifice every one who is dear to me. One day she
shall be mine&mdash;mine <a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>at
whatever cost&mdash;if she will be. If she will be. Ah, there is
the rub! If she will be. I dare not hope for that."</p>
<p>"I think," said I, "that you really have some little cause to
hope."</p>
<p>"You speak in the same tone again. Malcolm, you do not
understand her. She might love me to the extent that I sometimes
hope; but her father and mine would never consent to our union, and
she, I fear, could not be induced to marry me under those
conditions. Do not put the hope into my heart."</p>
<p>"You only now said she should be yours some day," I
answered.</p>
<p>"So she shall," returned John, "so she shall."</p>
<p>"But Lady Madge is to be with her to-morrow," said I, my own
heart beating with an ardent wish and a new-born hope, "and you may
be unable, after all, to see Mistress Dorothy."</p>
<p>"That is true," replied John. "I do not know how she will
arrange matters, but I have faith in her ingenuity."</p>
<p>Well might he have faith, for Dorothy was possessed of that sort
of a will which usually finds a way.</p>
<p>"If you wish me to go with you to Derby-town, I will do so.
Perhaps I may be able to entertain Lady Madge while you have a word
with Dorothy. What think you of the plan?" I asked.</p>
<p>"If you will go with me, Malcolm, I shall thank you with all my
heart."</p>
<p>And so it was agreed between us that we should both go to
Derby-town for the purpose of inquiring about Lady Crawford's
health, though for me the expedition was full of hazard.</p>

"Page_108"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h2>A DANGEROUS TRIP TO DERBY-TOWN</h2>
<p>The next morning broke brightly, but soon clouds began to gather
and a storm seemed imminent. We feared that the gloomy prospect of
the sky might keep Dorothy and Madge at home, but long before the
appointed hour John and I were at the Royal Arms watching eagerly
for the Haddon coach. At the inn we occupied a room from which we
could look into the courtyard, and at the window we stood
alternating between exaltation and despair.</p>
<p>When my cogitations turned upon myself&mdash;a palpitating youth
of thirty-five, waiting with beating heart for a simple blind girl
little more than half my age; and when I remembered how for years I
had laughed at the tenderness of the fairest women of the French
and Scottish courts&mdash;I could not help saying to myself, "Poor
fool! you have achieved an early second childhood." But when I
recalled Madge in all her beauty, purity, and helplessness, my
cynicism left me, and I, who had enjoyed all of life's ambitious
possibilities, calmly reached the conclusion that it is sometimes a
blessed privilege to be a fool. While I dwelt on thoughts of Madge,
all the latent good within me came uppermost. There is latent good
in every man, though it may remain latent all his life. Good
resolves, pure thoughts, and noble aspirations&mdash;new sensations
to me, I blush to confess&mdash;bubbled <a name="Page_109" id=
"Page_109"></a>in my heart, and I made a mental prayer, "If this is
folly, may God banish wisdom." What is there, after all is said, in
wisdom, that men should seek it? Has it ever brought happiness to
its possessor? I am an old man at this writing. I have tasted all
the cups of life, and from the fulness of my experience I tell you
that the simple life is the only one wherein happiness is found.
When you permit your heart and your mind to grow complex and wise,
you make nooks and crannies for wretchedness to lodge in. Innocence
is Nature's wisdom; knowledge is man's folly.</p>
<p>An hour before noon our patience was rewarded when we saw the
Haddon Hall coach drive into the courtyard with Dawson on the box.
I tried to make myself believe that I did not wish Lady Crawford
were ill. But there is little profit in too close scrutiny of our
deep-seated motives, and in this case I found no comfort in
self-examination. I really did wish that Aunt Dorothy were ill.</p>
<p>My motive studying, however, was brought to a joyous end when I
saw Will Dawson close the coach door after Madge and Dorothy had
alighted.</p>
<p>How wondrously beautiful they were! Had we lived in the days
when Olympus ruled the world, John surely would have had a god for
his rival. Dorothy seemed luminous, so radiant was she with the
fire of life. As for Madge, had I beheld a corona hovering over her
head I should have thought it in all respects a natural and
appropriate phenomenon&mdash;so fair and saintlike did she appear
to me. Her warm white furs and her clinging gown of soft
light-colored woollen stuff seemed to be a saint's robe, and her
dainty little hat, fashioned with ermine about the edge of the
rim&mdash;well, that was the corona, and I was ready to
worship.</p>
<p>Dorothy, as befitted her, wore a blaze of harmonious colors and
looked like the spirit of life and youth. I wish<a name="Page_110"
id="Page_110"></a> I could cease rhapsodizing over those two girls,
but I cannot. You may pass over it as you read, if you do not like
it.</p>
<p>"Ye gods! did ever a creature so perfect as she tread the
earth?" asked John, meaning, of course, Dorothy.</p>
<p>"No," answered I, meaning, of course, Madge.</p>
<p>The girls entered the inn, and John and I descended to the
tap-room for the purpose of consulting Will Dawson concerning the
state of Aunt Dorothy's health.</p>
<p>When we entered the tap-room Will was standing near the
fireplace with a mug of hot punch in his hand. When I touched him,
he almost dropped the mug so great was his surprise at seeing
me.</p>
<p>"Sir Mal&mdash;" he began to say, but I stopped him by a
gesture. He instantly recovered his composure and appeared not to
recognize me.</p>
<p>I spoke in broken English, for, as you know, I belong more to
France than to any other country. "I am Sir Fran&ccedil;ois de
Lorraine," said I. "I wish to inquire if Lady Crawford is in good
health?"</p>
<p>"Her ladyship is ill, sir, I am sorry to say," responded Will,
taking off his hat. "Mistress Vernon and Lady Madge Stanley are at
the inn. If you wish to inquire more particularly concerning Lady
Crawford's health, I will ask them if they wish to receive you.
They are in the parlor."</p>
<p>Will was the king of trumps!</p>
<p>"Say to them," said I, "that Sir Fran&ccedil;ois de
Lorraine&mdash;mark the name carefully, please&mdash;and his friend
desire to make inquiry concerning Lady Crawford's health, and would
deem it a great honor should the ladies grant them an
interview."</p>
<p>Will's countenance was as expressionless as the face upon the
mug from which he had been drinking. "I shall inform the ladies of
your honor's request."<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a> He
thereupon placed the half-emptied mug upon the fire-shelf and left
the room.</p>
<p>When Will announced his errand to the girls, Dorothy said in
surprise:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sir Fran&ccedil;ois de Lorraine? That is the name of the Grand
Duc de Guise, but surely&mdash;Describe him to me, Will."</p>
<p>"He is about your height, Mistress Dorothy, and is very
handsome," responded Will.</p>
<p>The latter part of Will's description placed me under obligation
to him to the extent of a gold pound sterling.</p>
<p>"Ah, it is John!" thought Dorothy, forgetting the fact that John
was a great deal taller than she, but feeling that Will's
description of "very handsome" could apply to only one man in the
world. "He has taken Malcolm's name." Then she said, "Bring him to
us, Will. But who is the friend? Do you know him? Tell me his
appearance."</p>
<p>"I did not notice the other gentleman," replied Will, "and I can
tell you nothing of him."</p>
<p>"Will, you are a very stupid man. But bring the gentlemen here."
Dorothy had taken Will into her confidence to the extent of telling
him that a gentleman would arrive at the Royal Arms who would
inquire for Lady Crawford's health, and that she, Dorothy, would
fully inform the gentleman upon that interesting topic. Will may
have had suspicions of his own, but if so, he kept them to himself,
and at least did not know that the gentleman whom his mistress
expected to see was Sir John Manners. Neither did he suspect that
fact. Dawson had never seen Manners, and did not know he was in the
neighborhood of Derby. The fact was concealed from Dawson by
Dorothy not so much because she doubted him, but for the reason
that she wished him to be able truthfully to plead innocence in
case trouble should grow out of the Derby-town escapade.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>I wonder why John did not
come alone?" thought Dorothy. "This friend of his will be a great
hindrance."</p>
<p>Dorothy ran to the mirror and hurriedly gave a few touches to
her hair, pressing it lightly with her soft flexible fingers here,
and tucking in a stray curl there, which for beauty's sake should
have been allowed to hang loose. She was standing at the pier-glass
trying to see the back of her head when Will knocked to announce
our arrival.</p>
<p>"Come," said Dorothy.</p>
<p>Will opened the door and held it for us to pass in. Madge was
seated near the fire. When we entered Dorothy was standing with
great dignity in the centre of the floor, not of course intending
to make an exhibition of delight over John in the presence of a
stranger. But when she saw that I was the stranger, she ran to me
with outstretched hands.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Mistress Vernon," said I, in mock
ceremoniousness.</p>
<p>"Oh, Malcolm! Malcolm!" cried Madge, quickly rising from her
chair. "You are cruel, Dorothy, to surprise me in this
fashion."</p>
<p>"I, too, am surprised. I did not know that Malcolm was coming,"
replied Dorothy, turning to give welcome to John. Then I stepped to
Madge's side and took her hands, but all I could say was "Madge!
Madge!" and all she said was "Malcolm! Malcolm!" yet we seemed to
understand each other.</p>
<p>John and Dorothy were likewise stricken with a paucity of words,
but they also doubtless understood each other. After a moment or
two there fell upon me a shower of questions from Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Did you not go to France? How happens it that you are in
Derby-town? Where did you meet Sir John? What a delightful surprise
you have given us! Nothing was wanting to make us happy but your
presence."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>I am so happy that it
frightens me," said Dorothy in ecstasy. "Trouble will come, I am
sure. One extreme always follows another. The pendulum always
swings as far back as it goes forward. But we are happy now, aren't
we, Madge? I intend to remain so while I can. The pendulum may
swing as far backward as it chooses hereafter. Sufficient to the
day is the evil thereof. Sometimes the joy is almost sufficient,
isn't it, Madge?"</p>
<p>"The evil is more than sufficient some days," answered
Madge.</p>
<p>"Come, Madge, don't be foreboding."</p>
<p>"Dorothy, I have not met the other gentleman," said Madge.</p>
<p>"Ah, pardon me. In my surprise I forgot to present you. Lady
Madge Stanley, let me present Sir John Manners."</p>
<p>"Sir John Manners!" cried Madge, taking a step backward. Her
surprise was so great that she forgot to acknowledge the
introduction. "Dorothy, what means this?" she continued.</p>
<p>"It means," replied Dorothy, nervously, "that Sir John is my
very dear friend. I will explain it to you at another time."</p>
<p>We stood silently for a few moments, and John said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I hope I may find favor in your heart, Lady Madge. I wish to
greet you with my sincere homage."</p>
<p>"Sir John, I am glad to greet you, but I fear the pendulum of
which Dorothy spoke will swing very far backward erelong."</p>
<p>"Let it swing as far back as it chooses," answered Dorothy, with
a toss of her head, "I am ready to buy and to pay for happiness.
That seems to be the only means whereby we may have it. I am ready
to buy it with pain any day, and am willing to pay upon demand.
Pain passes away; joy lasts forever."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>I know," said Sir John,
addressing Madge, "I know it is not prudent for Malcolm and me to
be here to-day; but imprudent things seem to be the most
delightful."</p>
<p>"For men, Sir John," returned Madge. "Upon women they leave
their mark."</p>
<p>"I fear you are right," he answered. "I had not thought of my
visit in that light. For Mistress Vernon's sake it is better that I
do not remain in Derby."</p>
<p>"For Mistress Vernon's sake you shall remain," cried that
impetuous young woman, clutching John's arm.</p>
<p>After a time, Dorothy wishing to visit one of the shops to make
purchases, it was agreed between us that we should all walk out.
Neither Dorothy nor Madge had ever before visited Derby-town. John
and I had visited the place but once; that was upon the occasion of
our first meeting. No one in the town knew us, and we felt safe in
venturing forth into the streets. So we helped Dorothy and Madge to
don their furs, and out we went happier and more reckless than four
people have any good right to be. But before setting out I went to
the tap-room and ordered dinner.</p>
<p>I found the host and directed him to prepare a dozen partridges
in a pie, a haunch of venison, a few links of German sausage, and a
capon. The host informed me that he had in his pantry a barrel of
roots called potatoes which had been sent to him by a sea-captain
who had recently returned from the new world. He hurried away and
brought a potato for inspection. It was of a gray brown color and
near the size of an egg. The landlord assured me that it was
delicious when baked, and I ordered four, at the cost of a crown
each. I understand that my Lord Raleigh claims to have brought the
first potatoes and tobacco into England in '85; but I know that I
smoked tobacco in '66, and I saw potatoes at the Royal Arms in
Derby-town in '67. I also ordered another new dish for our famous
dinner. It was a brown beverage called coffee.<a name="Page_115"
id="Page_115"></a> The berries from which the beverage is made mine
host showed to me, and said they had been brought to him by a
sea-faring man from Arabia. I ordered a pot of the drink at a cost
of three crowns. I have heard it said that coffee was not known in
Europe or in England till it was introduced by Rawolf in '73, but I
saw it at the Royal Arms in '67. In addition to this list, I
ordered for our drinking sweet wine from Madeira and red wine from
Burgundy. The latter-named wine had begun to grow in favor at the
French court when I left France five years before. It was little
liked in England. All these dainties were rare at the time of which
I write; but they have since grown into considerable use, and I
doubt not, as we progress in luxury, they will become common
articles of food upon the tables of the rich. Prongs, or forks, as
they are called, which by some are used in cutting and eating one's
food at table, I also predict will become implements of daily use.
It is really a filthy fashion, which we have, of handling food with
our fingers. The Italians have used forks for some time, but our
preachers speak against them, saying God has given us our fingers
with which to eat, and that it is impious to thwart his purposes by
the use of forks. The preachers will probably retard the general
use of forks among the common people.</p>
<p>After I had given my order for dinner we started out on our
ramble through Derby-town.</p>
<p>Shortly after we left the inn we divided into couples for the
ostensible reason that we did not wish to attract too much
attention&mdash;Dorothy and John, Madge and I! Our real reason for
separating was&mdash;but you understand.</p>
<p>Madge's hand lay like a span of snow upon my arm, and&mdash;but
this time I will restrain my tendency to rhapsodize.</p>
<p>We walked out through those parts of the town which were little
used, and Madge talked freely and happily.</p>
<p><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>She fairly babbled, and to
me her voice was like the murmurings of the rivers that flowed out
of paradise.</p>
<p>We had agreed with John and Dorothy to meet them at the Royal
Arms in one hour, and that time had almost passed when Madge and I
turned our faces toward the inn.</p>
<p>When we were within a short distance of our hostelry we saw a
crowd gathered around a young man who was standing on a box. He was
speaking in a mournful, lugubrious voice and accompanied his words
with violent gesticulations. Out of curiosity we stopped to listen,
and learned that religion was our orator's theme.</p>
<p>I turned to a man standing near me and asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Who is the fellow speaking?"</p>
<p>"The pious man is Robert Brown. He is exhorting in the name of
the Lord of Hosts."</p>
<p>"The pious Robert Brown?" I queried, "exhorting in the name
of&mdash;of the Lord of where, did you say?"</p>
<p>"Hosts," laconically responded my friend, while listening
intently to the words of Brown.</p>
<p>"Hosts, say you? Who is he?" I asked of my interesting neighbor.
"I know him not."</p>
<p>"Doubtless you know Him not," responded the man, evidently
annoyed at my interruption and my flippancy.</p>
<p>After a moment or two I, desiring to know more concerning the
orator, asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Robert Brown, say you?"</p>
<p>"Even he," came the response. "It will be good for your soul if
you but listen to him in a prayerful mood. He is a young man upon
whom the Spirit hath descended plenteously."</p>
<p>"The Spirit?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Ay," returned my neighbor.</p>
<p>I could not extract another word from him, so I had the worst of
the encounter.</p>
<p><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>We had been standing there
but a short time when the young exhorter descended from his
improvised pulpit and passed among the crowd for the purpose of
collecting money. His harangue had appeared ridiculous to me, but
Madge seemed interested in his discourse. She said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"He is very earnest, Malcolm," and at once my heart went out to
the young enthusiast upon the box. One kind word from Madge, and I
was the fellow's friend for life. I would have remained his friend
had he permitted me that high privilege. But that he would not do.
When he came to me, I dropped into his hat a small silver piece
which shone brightly among a few black copper coins. My liberal
contribution did not induce him to kindness, but, on the contrary,
it attracted his attention to the giver. He looked at the silver
coin, and then turning his solemn gaze upon me, eyed me insolently
from head to foot. While doing so a look of profound disgust spread
over his mournful countenance. After a calm survey of my person,
which to me was uncomfortably long, he turned to the bystanders,
and in the same high-pitched, lugubrious voice which he had used
when exhorting, said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Brethren, here behold ye the type of anti-Christ," and he waved
his thin hand toward me much to my amusement and annoyance. "Here,"
said he, "we find the leading strings to all that is
iniquitous&mdash;vanity. It is betokened in his velvets, satins,
and laces. Think ye, young man," he said, turning to me, "that such
vanities are not an abomination in the eyes of the God of
Israel?"</p>
<p>"I believe that the God of Israel cares nothing about my
apparel," I replied, more amused than angered. He paid no attention
to my remark.</p>
<p>"And this young woman," he continued, pointing to Madge, "this
young woman, daughter of the Roman harlot, no doubt, she also is
arrayed in silks, taffetas, and fine cloth. Look ye, friends, upon
this abominable collar of<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>
Satan; this ruff of fine linen, all smeared in the devil's own
liquor, starch. Her vanity is an offence in the nostrils of God's
people."</p>
<p>As he spoke he stretched forth his hand and caught in his
clawlike grasp the dainty white ruff that encircled Madge's neck.
When I saw his act, my first impulse was to run him through, and I
drew my sword half from its scabbard with that purpose. But he was
not the sort of a man upon whom I could use my blade. He was hardly
more than a boy&mdash;a wild, half-crazed fanatic, whose reason, if
he had ever possessed any, had been lost in the Charybdis of his
zeal. He honestly thought it was his duty to insult persons who
apparently disagreed with him. Such a method of proselyting is
really a powerful means of persuasion among certain classes, and it
has always been used by men who have successfully founded permanent
religious sects. To plant successfully a religious thought or
system requires more violent aggression than to conquer a
nation.</p>
<p>Since I could not run the fellow through, I drew back my arm,
and striking as lightly as possible, I laid our zealous friend
sprawling on his back. Thus had I the honor of knocking down the
founder of the Brownists.</p>
<p>If I mistake not, the time will come, if these men are allowed
to harangue the populace, when the kings of England will be unable
to accomplish the feat of knocking down Brown's followers.
Heresies, like noxious weeds, grow without cultivation, and thrive
best on barren soil. Or shall I say that, like the goodly vine,
they bear better fruit when pruned? I cannot fully decide this
question for myself; but I admire these sturdy fanatics who so
passionately love their own faith, and so bitterly hate all others,
and I am almost prepared to say that each new heresy brings to the
world a better orthodoxy.</p>
<p>For a little time after my encounter with Brown, all my skill
was needed to ward off the frantic hero. He <a name="Page_119" id=
"Page_119"></a>quickly rose to his feet, and, with the help of his
friends, seemed determined to spread the gospel by tearing me to
pieces. My sword point kept the rabble at a respectful distance for
a while, but they crowded closely upon me, and I should have been
compelled to kill some of them had I not been re&euml;nforced by
two men who came to my help and laid about them most joyfully with
their quarterstaffs. A few broken heads stemmed for a moment the
torrent of religious enthusiasm, and during a pause in the
hostilities I hurriedly retreated with Madge, ungratefully leaving
my valiant allies to reap the full reward of victory should the
fortunes of war favor them.</p>
<p>Madge was terribly frightened, and with her by my side I, of
course, would not have remained to fight the redoubtable Bayard
himself.</p>
<p>We hurried forward, but before we reached the inn we were
overtaken by our allies whom we had abandoned. Our friends were
young men. One wore a rich, half-rustic habit, and the other was
dressed as a horse boy. Both were intoxicated. I had been thankful
for their help; but I did not want their company.</p>
<p>"How now, Cousin Madge?" said our richly dressed ally. "What in
the devil's name has brought you into this street broil?"</p>
<p>"Ah, Cousin James, is it you?" replied the trembling girl.</p>
<p>"Yes, but who is your friend that so cleverly unloaded his
quarrel upon us? Hell's fires! but they were like a swarm of wasps.
Who is your friend, Madge?"</p>
<p>"Sir Malcolm Vernon," replied Madge. "Let me present you, Sir
Malcolm, to my cousin, Lord James Stanley."</p>
<p>I offered my hand to his Lordship, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I thank you much for your timely help. I should not have
deserted you had I not felt that my first duty was to extricate
Lady Madge from the disagreeable situation. We <a name="Page_120"
id="Page_120"></a>must hasten away from here, or the mad rabble
will follow us."</p>
<p>"Right you are, my hearty," returned Stanley, slapping me on the
shoulder. "Of course you had to get the wench away. Where do you
go? We will bear you company."</p>
<p>I longed to pay the fellow for his help by knocking him down;
but the possibilities of trouble ahead of us were already too
great, and I forced myself to be content with the prowess already
achieved.</p>
<p>"But you have not told me what brought you into the broil,"
asked his Lordship, as we walked toward the inn.</p>
<p>"Sir Malcolm and I were walking out to see the town
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"To see the town? By gad, that's good, Cousin Madge. How much of
it did you see? You are as blind as an owl at noon," answered his
Lordship.</p>
<p>"Alas! I am blind," returned Madge, clinging closely to me, and
shrinking from her cousin's terrible jest. I could not think of
anything sufficiently holy and sacred upon which to vow my
vengeance against this fellow, if the time should ever come when I
dared take it.</p>
<p>"Are you alone with this&mdash;this gentleman?" asked his
Lordship, grasping Madge by the arm.</p>
<p>"No," returned Madge, "Dorothy is with us."</p>
<p>"She is among the shops," I volunteered reluctantly.</p>
<p>"Dorothy? Dorothy Vernon? By gad, Tod, we are in luck. I must
see the wench I am to marry," said his Lordship, speaking to his
companion, the stable boy. "So Dorothy is with you, is she, cousin?
I haven't seen her for years. They say she is a handsome filly now.
By gad, she had room to improve, for she was plain enough, to
frighten rats away from a barn when I last saw her. We will go to
the inn and see for ourselves, won't we, Tod? Dad's word won't
satisfy us when it comes to the matter of marrying, will it,
Tod?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>Tod was the drunken stable
boy who had assisted his Lordship and me in our battle with the
Brownists.</p>
<p>I was at a loss what course to pursue. I was forced to submit to
this fellow's company, and to endure patiently his insolence. But
John and Dorothy would soon return, and there is no need that I
should explain the dangers of the predicament which would then
ensue.</p>
<p>When we were within a few yards of the inn door I looked
backward and saw Dorothy and John approaching us. I held up my hand
warningly. John caught my meaning, and instantly leaving Dorothy's
side, entered an adjacent shop. My movement had attracted Stanley's
attention, and he turned in the direction I had been looking. When
he saw Dorothy, he turned again to me and asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Is that Dorothy Vernon?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>
<p>"Look at her, Tod!" exclaimed my lord, "look at her, Tod! The
dad was right about her, after all. I thought the old man was
hoaxing me when he told me that she was beautiful. Holy Virgin,
Tod, did you ever see anything so handsome? I will take her quick
enough; I will take her. Dad won't need to tease me. I'm
willing."</p>
<p>Dorothy approached to within a few yards of us, and my Lord
Stanley stepped forward to meet her.</p>
<p>"Ye don't know me, do ye?" said Stanley.</p>
<p>Dorothy was frightened and quickly stepped to my side.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I believe not," responded Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Lord James Stanley," murmured Madge, who knew of the
approaching Stanley marriage.</p>
<p>"Madge is right," returned. Stanley, grinning foolishly. "I am
your cousin James, but not so much of a cousin that I cannot be
more than cousin, heh?" He laughed boisterously, and winking at
Tod, thrust his thumb into <a name="Page_122" id=
"Page_122"></a>that worthy's ribs. "Say, Tod, something more than
cousin; that's the thing, isn't it, Tod?"</p>
<p>John was standing half-concealed at the door of the shop in
which he had sought refuge. Dorothy well knew the peril of the
situation, and when I frowned at her warningly, she caught the hint
that she should not resent Stanley's words, however insulting and
irritating they might become.</p>
<p>"Let us go to the inn," said Dorothy.</p>
<p>"That's the thing to do. Let us go to the inn and have dinner,"
said Stanley. "It's two hours past dinner time now, and I'm almost
famished. We'll have a famous dinner. Come, cousin," said he,
addressing Dorothy. "We'll have kidneys and tripe and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"We do not want dinner," said Dorothy. "We must return home at
once. Sir Malcolm, will you order Dawson to bring out the
coach?"</p>
<p>We went to the inn parlor, and I, loath to do so, left the
ladies with Stanley and his horse-boy friend while I sought Dawson
for the purpose of telling him to fetch the coach with all
haste.</p>
<p>"We have not dined," said the forester.</p>
<p>"We shall not dine," I answered. "Fetch the coach with all the
haste you can make." The bystanders in the tap-room were listening,
and I continued, "A storm is brewing, and we must hasten home."</p>
<p>True enough, a storm was brewing.</p>
<p>When I left Dawson, I hurriedly found John and told him we were
preparing to leave the inn, and that we would expect him to
overtake us on the road to Rowsley.</p>
<p>I returned to the ladies in the parlor and found them standing
near the window. Stanley had tried to kiss Dorothy, and she had
slapped his face. Fortunately he had taken the blow good-humoredly,
and was pouring into her unwilling ear a fusillade of boorish
compliments when. I entered the parlor.</p>
<p><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>I said, "The coach is
ready."</p>
<p>The ladies moved toward the door. "I am going to ride with you,
my beauty," said his Lordship.</p>
<p>"That you shall not do," retorted Dorothy, with blazing
eyes.</p>
<p>"That I will do," he answered. "The roads are free to all, and
you cannot keep me from following you."</p>
<p>Dorothy was aware of her predicament, and I too saw it, but
could find no way out of it. I was troubled a moment; but my fear
was needless, for Dorothy was equal to the occasion.</p>
<p>"We should like your company, Cousin Stanley," replied Dorothy,
without a trace of anger in her manner, "but we cannot let you ride
with us in the face of the storm that is brewing."</p>
<p>"We won't mind the storm, will we, Tod? We are going with our
cousin."</p>
<p>"If you insist upon being so kind to us," said Dorothy, "you may
come. But I have changed my mind about dinner. I am very hungry,
and we accept your invitation."</p>
<p>"Now you are coming around nicely," said Lord James, joyfully.
"We like that, don't we, Tod?"</p>
<p>Tod had been silent under all circumstances.</p>
<p>Dorothy continued: "Madge and I will drive in the coach to one
or two of the shops, and we shall return in one hour. Meantime,
Cousin Stanley, we wish you to have a fine dinner prepared for us,
and we promise to do ample justice to the fare."</p>
<p>"She'll never come back," said silent Tod, without moving a
muscle.</p>
<p>"How about it, cousin?" asked Stanley. "Tod says you'll never
come back; he means that you are trying to give us the slip."</p>
<p>"Never fear, Cousin Stanley," she returned, "I am too <a name=
"Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>eager for dinner not to come back. If
you fail to have a well-loaded table for me, I shall never speak to
you again."</p>
<p>We then went to the coach, and as the ladies entered it Dorothy
said aloud to Dawson:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Drive to Conn's shop."</p>
<p>I heard Tod say to his worthy master:&mdash;</p>
<p>"She's a slippin' ye."</p>
<p>"You're a fool, Tod. Don't you see she wants me more than she
wants the dinner, and she's hungry, too."</p>
<p>"Don't see," retorted his laconic friend.</p>
<p>Of course when the coach was well away from the inn, Dawson
received new instructions, and took the road to Rowsley. When the
ladies had departed, I went to the tap-room with Stanley, and after
paying the host for the coffee, the potatoes, and the dinner which
alas! we had not tasted, I ordered a great bowl of sack and
proceeded to drink with my allies in the hope that I might make
them too drunk to follow us. Within half an hour I discovered that
I was laboring at a hopeless task. There was great danger that I
would be the first to succumb; so I, expressing a wish to sleep off
the liquor before the ladies should return, made my escape from the
tap-room, mounted my horse, and galloped furiously after Dorothy
and Madge. John was riding by the coach when I overtook it.</p>
<p>It was two hours past noon when I came up with John and the
girls. Snow had been falling softly earlier in the afternoon, but
as the day advanced the storm grew in violence. A cold, bleak wind
was blowing from the north, and by reason of the weather and
because of the ill condition of the roads, the progress of the
coach was so slow that darkness overtook us before we had finished
half of our journey to Rowsley. Upon the fall of night the storm
increased in violence, and the snow came in piercing, horizontal
shafts which stung like the prick of a needle.</p>
<p><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>At the hour of six&mdash;I
but guessed the time&mdash;John and I, who were riding at the rear
of the coach, heard close on our heels the trampling of horses. I
rode forward to Dawson, who was in the coach box, and told him to
drive with all the speed he could make. I informed him that some
one was following us, and that I feared highwaymen were on our
track.</p>
<p>Hardly had I finished speaking to Dawson when I heard the report
of a hand-fusil, back of the coach, near the spot where I had left
John. I quickly drew my sword, though it was a task of no small
labor, owing to the numbness of my fingers. I breathed along the
blade to warm it, and then I hastened to John, whom I found in a
desperate conflict with three ruffians. No better swordsman than
John ever drew blade, and he was holding his ground in the darkness
right gallantly. When I rode to his rescue, another hand-fusil was
discharged, and then another, and I knew that we need have no more
fear from bullets, for the three men had discharged their weapons,
and they could not reload while John and I were engaging them. I
heard the bullets tell upon the coach, and I heard the girls
screaming lustily. I feared they had been wounded, but you may be
sure I had no leisure to learn the truth. Three against two was
terrible odds in the dark, where brute force and luck go for more
than skill. We fought desperately for a while, but in the end we
succeeded in beating off the highwaymen. When we had finished with
the knaves who had attacked us, we quickly overtook our party. We
were calling Dawson to stop when we saw the coach, careening with
the slant of the hill, topple over, and fall to the bottom of a
little precipice five or six feet in height. We at once dismounted
and jumped down the declivity to the coach, which lay on its side,
almost covered by drifted snow. The pole had broken in the fall,
and the horses were standing on the road. We first <a name=
"Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>saw Dawson. He was swearing like a
Dutchman, and when we had dragged him from his snowy grave, we
opened the coach door, lifted out the ladies, and seated them upon
the uppermost side of the coach. They were only slightly bruised,
but what they lacked in bruises they made up in fright. In respect
to the latter it were needless for me to attempt a description.</p>
<p>We can laugh about it now and speak lightly concerning the
adventure, and, as a matter of truth, the humor of the situation
appealed to me even then. But imagine yourself in the predicament,
and you will save me the trouble of setting forth its real
terrors.</p>
<p>The snow was up to our belts, and we did not at first know how
we were to extricate the ladies. John and Dawson, however, climbed
to the road, and I carried Dorothy and Madge to the little
precipice where the two men at the top lifted them from my arms.
The coach was broken, and when I climbed to the road, John, Dawson,
and myself held a council of war against the storm. Dawson said we
were three good miles from Rowsley, and that he knew of no house
nearer than the village at which we could find shelter. We could
not stand in the road and freeze, so I got the blankets and robes
from the coach and made riding pads for Dorothy and Madge. These we
strapped upon the broad backs of the coach horses, and then
assisted the ladies to mount. I walked by the side of Madge, and
John performed the same agreeable duty for Dorothy. Dawson went
ahead of us, riding my horse and leading John's; and thus we
travelled to Rowsley, half dead and nearly frozen, over the longest
three miles in the kingdom.</p>
<p>John left us before entering the village, and took the road to
Rutland, intending to stop for the night at a cottage two miles
distant, upon his father's estates. I was to follow Sir John when
the ladies were safely lodged at The Peacock.</p>
<p><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>It was agreed between us
that nothing should be said concerning the presence of any man save
Dawson and myself in our party.</p>
<p>When John left us, I rode to The Peacock with Dorothy and Madge,
and while I was bidding them good-by my violent cousin, Sir George,
entered the inn. Dorothy ran to her father and briefly related the
adventures of the night, dwelling with undeserved emphasis upon the
help I had rendered. She told her father&mdash;the statement was
literally true&mdash;that she had met me at the Royal Arms, where I
was stopping, and that she had, through fear of the storm and in
dread of highwaymen, asked me to ride beside their coach to
Rowsley.</p>
<p>When I saw Sir George enter the room, I expected to have trouble
with him; but after he had spoken with Dorothy, much to my
surprise, he offered me his hand and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I thank you, Malcolm, for the help you have rendered my girls,
and I am glad you have come back to us."</p>
<p>"I have not come back to you, Sir George," said I, withholding
my hand. "I met Mistress Vernon and Lady Madge at the Royal Arms,
and escorted them to Rowsley for reasons which she has just given
to you. I was about to depart when you entered."</p>
<p>"Tut, tut! Malcolm, you will come with us to Haddon Hall."</p>
<p>"To be ordered away again, Sir George?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I did not order you to go. You left in a childish fit of anger.
Why in the devil's name did you run away so quickly? Could you not
have given a man time to cool off? You treated me very badly,
Malcolm."</p>
<p>"Sir George, you certainly know&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know nothing of the sort. Now I want not another word from
you. Damme! I say, not another word. If I ever ordered you to leave
Haddon Hall, I didn't know what I was doing," cried Sir George,
heartily.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>But you may again not
know," said I.</p>
<p>"Now, Malcolm, don't be a greater fool than I was. If I say I
did not order you to leave Haddon Hall, can't you take me at my
word? My age and my love for you should induce you to let me ease
my conscience, if I can. If the same illusion should ever come over
you again&mdash;that is, if you should ever again imagine that I am
ordering you to leave Haddon Hall&mdash;well, just tell me to go to
the devil. I have been punished enough already, man. Come home with
us. Here is Dorothy, whom I love better than I love myself. In
anger I might say the same thing to her that I said to you,
but&mdash;Nonsense, Malcolm, don't be a fool. Come home with us.
Haddon is your home as freely as it is the home of Dorothy, Madge,
and myself."</p>
<p>The old gentleman's voice trembled, and I could not withstand
the double force of his kindness and my desire. So it came about
that when Madge held out her fair hand appealingly to me, and when
Dorothy said, "Please come home with us, Cousin Malcolm," I offered
my hand to Sir George, and with feeling said, "Let us make this
promise to each other: that nothing hereafter shall come between
us."</p>
<p>"I gladly promise," responded the generous, impulsive old man.
"Dorothy, Madge, and you are all in this world whom I love. Nothing
shall make trouble between us. Whatever happens, we will each
forgive."</p>
<p>The old gentleman was in his kindest, softest mood.</p>
<p>"Let us remember the words," said I.</p>
<p>"I give my hand and my word upon it," cried Sir George.</p>
<p>How easy it is to stake the future upon a present impulse. But
when the time for reckoning comes,&mdash;when the future becomes
the present,&mdash;it is sometimes hard to pay the priceless
present for the squandered past. Next morning we all rode home to
Haddon,&mdash;how sweet <a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>the
words sound even at this distance of time!&mdash;and there was
rejoicing in the Hall as if the prodigal had returned.</p>
<p>In the evening I came upon Madge unawares. She was softly
singing a plaintive little love song. I did not disturb her, and as
I stole away again I said to myself, "God is good." A realization
of that great truth had of late been growing upon me. When once we
thoroughly learn it, life takes on a different color.</p>

<h2>TRIBULATION IN HADDON</h2>
<p>After I had left Haddon at Sir George's tempestuous order, he
had remained in a state of furious anger against Dorothy and myself
for a fortnight or more. But after her adroit conversation with him
concerning the Stanley marriage, wherein she neither promised nor
refused, and after she learned that she could more easily cajole
her father than command him, Dorothy easily ensconced herself again
in his warm heart, and took me into that capacious abode along with
her.</p>
<p>Then came the trip to Derby, whereby his serene Lordship, James
Stanley, had been enabled to see Dorothy and to fall in love with
her winsome beauty, and whereby I was brought back to Haddon.
Thereafter came events crowding so rapidly one upon the heels of
another that I scarce know where to begin the telling of them. I
shall not stop to say, "Sir George told me this," or "Madge,
Dorothy, or John told me that," but I shall write as if I had
personal knowledge of all that happened. After all, the important
fact is that I know the truth concerning matters whereof I write,
and of that you may rest with surety.</p>
<p>The snow lay upon the ground for a fortnight after the storm in
which we rode from Derby, but at the end of that time it melted,
and the sun shone with the brilliancy and warmth of springtide. So
warm and genial was the weather that the trees, flowers, and shrubs
were cozened into bud<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>ding
forth. The buds were withered by a killing frost which came upon us
later in the season at a time when the spring should have been
abroad in all her graciousness, and that year was called the year
of the leafless summer.</p>
<p>One afternoon Sir George received a distinguished guest in the
person of the Earl of Derby, and the two old gentlemen remained
closeted together for several hours. That night at supper, after
the ladies had risen from table, Sir George dismissed the servants
saying that he wished to speak to me in private. I feared that he
intended again bringing forward the subject of marriage with
Dorothy, but he soon relieved my mind.</p>
<p>"The Earl of Derby was here to-day. He has asked for Doll's hand
in marriage with his eldest son and heir, Lord James Stanley, and I
have granted the request."</p>
<p>"Indeed," I responded, with marvellous intelligence. I could say
nothing more, but I thought&mdash;in truth I knew&mdash;that it did
not lie within the power of any man in or out of England to dispose
of Dorothy Vernon's hand in marriage to Lord James Stanley. Her
father might make a murderess out of her, but Countess of Derby,
never.</p>
<p>Sir George continued, "The general terms of the marriage
contract have been agreed upon by the earl and me, and the lawyers
will do the rest."</p>
<p>"What is your feeling in the matter?" I asked aimlessly.</p>
<p>"My feeling?" cried Sir George. "Why, sir, my feeling is that
the girl shall marry Stanley just as soon as arrangements can be
made for the wedding ceremony. The young fellow, it seems, saw Doll
at Derby-town the day you came home, and since then he is eager,
his father tells me, for the union. He is coming to see her when I
give my permission, and I will send him word at as early a date as
propriety will admit. I must not let them be seen together too
soon, you know. There might be a hitch in <a name="Page_132" id=
"Page_132"></a>the marriage negotiations. The earl is a tight one
in business matters, and might drive a hard bargain with me should
I allow his son to place Doll in a false position before the
marriage contract is signed." He little knew how certainly Dorothy
herself would avoid that disaster.</p>
<p>He took a long draught from his mug of toddy and winked
knowingly at me, saying, "I am too wise for that."</p>
<p>"Have you told Dorothy?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No," he replied, "I have not exactly told her. I had a talk
with her a few days ago on the subject, though the earl and I had
not, at that time, entirely agreed upon the terms, and I did not
know that we should agree. But I told her of the pending
negotiations, because I wished to prepare her for the signing of
the contract; and also, by gad, Malcolm, I wanted to make the girl
understand at the outset that I will have no trifling with my
commands in this matter. I made that feature of the case very
plain, you may rest assured. She understands me fully, and although
at first she was a little inclined to fight, she soon&mdash;she
soon&mdash;well, she knuckled under gracefully when she found she
must."</p>
<p>"Did she consent to the marriage?" I asked, well knowing that
even if she had consented in words, she had no thought of doing so
in deed.</p>
<p>"Y-e-s," returned Sir George, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"I congratulate you," I replied.</p>
<p>"I shall grieve to lose Doll," the old man slowly continued with
perceptible signs of emotion. "I shall grieve to lose my girl, but
I am anxious to have the wedding over. You see, Malcolm, of late I
have noticed signs of wilfulness in Doll that can be more easily
handled by a husband than by a father. Marriage and children anchor
a woman, you know. In truth, I have opened my eyes to the fact that
Doll is growing dangerous. I'gad, the other day I thought she was a
child, but suddenly I learn <a name="Page_133" id=
"Page_133"></a>she is a woman. I had not before noticed the change.
Beauty and wilfulness, such as the girl has of late developed, are
powers not to be underestimated by wise men. There is hell in them,
Malcolm, I tell you there is hell in them." Sir George meditatively
snuffed the candle with his fingers and continued: "If a horse once
learns that he can kick&mdash;sell him. Only yesterday, as I said,
Doll was a child, and now, by Jove, she is a full-blown woman, and
I catch myself standing in awe of her and calling her Dorothy. Yes,
damme, standing in awe of my own child! That will never do, you
know. What has wrought the change? And, after all, what is the
change? I can't define it, but there has been a great one."</p>
<p>He was in a revery and spoke more to himself than to me.
"Yesterday she was my child&mdash;she was a child, and
now&mdash;and now&mdash;she is&mdash;she is&mdash;Why the devil
didn't you take her, Malcolm?" cried the old man, awakening. "But
there, never mind; that is all past and gone, and the future Earl
of Derby will be a great match for her."</p>
<p>"Do you know the future Earl of Derby?" I asked. "Have you ever
seen him?"</p>
<p>"No," Sir George replied. "I hear he is rather wild and uncouth,
but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My dear cousin," said I, interrupting him, "he is a vulgar,
drunken clown, whose associates have always been stable boys,
tavern maids, and those who are worse than either."</p>
<p>"What?" cried Sir George, hotly, the liquor having reached his
brain. "You won't have Doll yourself, and you won't consent to
another&mdash;damme, would you have the girl wither into
spinsterhood? How, sir, dare you interfere?"</p>
<p>"I withdraw all I said, Sir George," I replied hastily. "I have
not a word to say against the match. I thought&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>Well, damn you, sir, don't
think."</p>
<p>"You said you wished to consult me about the affair, and I
supposed&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't suppose either," replied Sir George, sullenly. "Supposing
and thinking have hanged many a man. I didn't wish to consult you.
I simply wanted to tell you of the projected marriage." Then after
a moment of half-maudlin, sullen silence he continued, "Go to bed,
Malcolm, go to bed, or we'll be quarrelling again."</p>
<p>I was glad enough to go to bed, for my cousin was growing drunk,
and drink made a demon of this man, whose violence when sober was
tempered by a heart full of tenderness and love.</p>
<p>Next morning Sir George was feeling irritable from the effects
of the brandy he had drunk over night. At breakfast, in the
presence of Lady Crawford, Madge, and myself, he abruptly informed
Dorothy that he was about to give that young goddess to Lord James
Stanley for his wife. He told her of the arrangement he had made
the day before with the Earl of Derby. Lady Crawford looked toward
her brother in surprise, and Madge pushed her chair a little way
back from the table with a startled movement. Dorothy sprang to her
feet, her eyes flashing fire and her breast rising and falling like
the storm-wrought pulsing of the sea. I coughed warningly and
placed my finger on my lips, making the sign of silence to Dorothy.
The girl made a wondrous and beautiful struggle against her wrath,
and in a moment all signs of ill-temper disappeared, and her face
took on an expression of sweet meekness which did not belong there
of right. She quietly sat down again, and when I looked at her, I
would have sworn that Griselda in the flesh was sitting opposite
me. Sir George was right. "Ways such as the girl had of late
developed were dangerous." Hell was in them to an extent little
dreamed of by her father. Breakfast was <a name="Page_135" id=
"Page_135"></a>finished in silence. Dorothy did not come down to
dinner at noon, but Sir George did not mark her absence. At supper
her place was still vacant.</p>
<p>"Where is Doll?" cried Sir George, angrily. He had been drinking
heavily during the afternoon. "Where is Doll?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"She is on the terrace," answered Madge. "She said she did not
want supper."</p>
<p>"Tell your mistress to come to supper," said Sir George,
speaking to one of the servants. "You will find her on the
terrace."</p>
<p>The servant left the room, but soon returned, saying that
Mistress Dorothy wanted no supper.</p>
<p>"Tell her to come to the table whether she wants supper or not.
Tell her I will put a stop to her moping about the place like a
surly vixen," growled Sir George.</p>
<p>"Don't send such a message by a servant," pleaded Lady
Crawford.</p>
<p>"Then take it to her yourself, Dorothy," exclaimed her
brother.</p>
<p>Dorothy returned with her aunt and meekly took her place at the
table.</p>
<p>"I will have none of your moping and pouting," said Sir George,
as Dorothy was taking her chair.</p>
<p>The girl made no reply, but she did not eat.</p>
<p>"Eat your supper," her father commanded. "I tell you I will have
no&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You would not have me eat if I am not hungry, would you,
father?" she asked softly.</p>
<p>"I'd have you hungry, you perverse wench."</p>
<p>"Then make me an appetite," returned the girl. I never heard
more ominous tones fall from human lips. They betokened a mood in
which one could easily do murder in cold blood, and I was surprised
that Sir George did not take warning and remain silent.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>I cannot make an appetite
for you, fool," he replied testily.</p>
<p>"Then you cannot make me eat," retorted Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Ah, you would answer me, would you, you brazen, insolent
huzzy," cried her father, angrily.</p>
<p>Dorothy held up her hand warningly to Sir George, and uttered
the one word, "Father." Her voice sounded like the clear, low ring
of steel as I have heard it in the stillness of sunrise during a
duel to the death. Madge gently placed her hand in Dorothy's, but
the caress met no response.</p>
<p>"Go to your room," answered Sir George.</p>
<p>Dorothy rose to her feet and spoke calmly: "I have not said that
I would disobey you in regard to this marriage which you have
sought for me; and your harshness, father, grows out of your effort
to reconcile your conscience with the outrage you would put upon
your own flesh and blood&mdash;your only child."</p>
<p>"Suffering God!" cried Sir George, frenzied with anger and
drink. "Am I to endure such insolence from my own child? The
lawyers will be here to-morrow. The contract will be signed, and,
thank God, I shall soon be rid of you. I'll place you in the hands
of one who will break your damnable will and curb your vixenish
temper." Then he turned to Lady Crawford. "Dorothy, if there is
anything to do in the way of gowns and women's trumpery in
preparation for the wedding, begin at once, for the ceremony shall
come off within a fortnight."</p>
<p>This was beyond Dorothy's power to endure. Madge felt the storm
coming and clutched her by the arm in an effort to stop her, but
nothing could have done that.</p>
<p>"I marry Lord Stanley?" she asked in low, bell-like tones, full
of contempt and disdain. "Marry that creature? Father, you don't
know me."</p>
<p>"By God, I know myself," retorted Sir George, "and I
say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>Now hear me, father," she
interrupted in a manner that silenced even him. She bent forward,
resting one fair hand upon the table, while she held out her other
arm bared to the elbow. "Hear what I say and take it for the truth
as if it had come from Holy Writ. I will open the veins in this arm
and will strew my blood in a gapless circle around Haddon Hall so
that you shall tread upon it whenever you go forth into the day or
into the night before I will marry the drunken idiot with whom you
would curse me. Ay, I will do more. I will kill you, if need be,
should you try to force him on me. Now, father, we understand each
other. At least you cannot fail to understand me. For the last time
I warn you. Beware of me."</p>
<p>She gently pushed the chair back from the table, quietly
adjusted the sleeve which she had drawn upward from her wrist, and
slowly walked out of the room, softly humming the refrain of a
roundelay. There was no trace of excitement about the girl. Her
brain was acting with the ease and precision of a perfectly
constructed machine. Sir George, by his violence and cruelty, had
made a fiend of this strong, passionate, tender heart. That was
all.</p>
<p>The supper, of course, was quickly finished, and the ladies left
the room.</p>
<p>Sir George took to his bottle and remained with it till his
servants put him to bed. I slipped away from him and smoked a pipe
in front of the kitchen fire. Then I went early to my bed in Eagle
Tower.</p>
<p>Dorothy went to her apartments. There she lay upon her bed, and
for a time her heart was like flint. Soon she thought of her
precious golden heart pierced with a silver arrow, and tears came
to her eyes as she drew the priceless treasure from her breast and
breathed upon it a prayer to the God of love for help. Her heart
was soft again, soft only as hers could be, and peace came <a name=
"Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>to her as she pressed John's golden
heart to her lips and murmured over and over the words, "My love,
my love, my love," and murmuring fell asleep.</p>
<p>I wonder how many of the countless women of this world found
peace, comfort, and ecstasy in breathing those magic words
yesterday? How many have found them to-day? How many will find them
to-morrow? No one can tell; but this I know, they come to every
woman at some time in her life, righteously or unrighteously, as
surely as her heart pulses.</p>
<p>That evening Jennie Faxton bore a letter to John, informing him
of the projected Stanley marriage. It asked him to meet the writer
at Bowling Green Gate, and begged him to help her if he could.</p>
<p>The small and intermittent remnants of conscience, sense of
duty, and caution which still remained in John's head&mdash;I will
not say in John's heart, for that was full to overflowing with
something else&mdash;were quickly banished by the unwelcome news in
Dorothy's letter. His first impulse was to kill Stanley; but John
Manners was not an assassin, and a duel would make public all he
wished to conceal. He wished to conceal, among other things, his
presence at Rutland. He had two reasons for so desiring. First in
point of time was the urgent purpose with which he had come to
Derbyshire. That purpose was to further a plan for the rescue of
Mary Stuart and to bring her incognito to Rutland Castle as a
refuge until Elizabeth could be persuaded to receive her. Of this
plan I knew nothing till after the disastrous attempt to carry it
out, of which I shall hereafter tell you. The other reason why John
wished his presence at Rutland unknown was that if he were supposed
to be in London, no one would suspect him of knowing Dorothy
Vernon.</p>
<p>You must remember there had been no overt love-making between
John and Dorothy up to that time. The <a name="Page_139" id=
"Page_139"></a>scene at the gate approached perilously near it, but
the line between concealment and confession had not been crossed.
Mind you, I say there had been no love-making <i>between</i> them.
While Dorothy had gone as far in that direction as a maiden should
dare go&mdash;and to tell the exact truth, a great deal
farther&mdash;John had remained almost silent for reasons already
given you. He also felt a fear of the girl, and failed to see in
her conduct those signs of intense love which would have been
plainly discernible had not his perceptions been blinded by the
fury of his own infatuation. He had placed a curb on his passion
and did not really know its strength and power until he learned
that another man was soon to possess the girl he loved. Then life
held but one purpose for him. Thus, you see that when Dorothy was
moaning, "My love, my love," and was kissing the golden heart, she
was taking a great deal for granted. Perhaps, however, she better
understood John's feeling for her than did he himself. A woman's
sixth sense, intuition, is a great help to her in such cases.
Perhaps the girl knew with intuitive confidence that her passion
was returned; and perhaps at first she found John's receptive mode
of wooing sweeter far than an aggressive attack would have been. It
may be also there was more of the serpent's cunning than of
reticence in John's conduct. He knew well the ways of women, and
perhaps he realized that if he would allow Dorothy to manage the
entire affair she would do his wooing for him much better than he
could do it for himself. If you are a man, try the plan upon the
next woman whom you seek to win. If she happens to be one who has
full confidence in her charms, you will be surprised at the result.
Women lacking that confidence are restrained by fear and doubt. But
in no case have I much faith in the hammer-and-tongs process at the
opening of a campaign. Later on, of course&mdash;but you doubtless
are quite as well <a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>informed
concerning this important subject as I. There is, however, so much
blundering in that branch of science that I have a mind to endow a
college at Oxford or at Paris in which shall be taught the gentle,
universally needed art of making love. What a noble attendance such
a college would draw. But I have wandered wofully from my
story.</p>
<p>I must go back a short time in my narrative. A few days before
my return to Haddon Hall the great iron key to the gate in the wall
east of Bowling Green Hill was missed from the forester's closet
where it had hung for a century or more. Bowling Green Hill, as you
know, is eastward from Haddon Hall a distance of the fourth part of
a mile, and the gate is east of the hill about the same distance or
less. A wall is built upon the east line of the Haddon estate, and
east of the wall lies a great trackless forest belonging to the
house of Devonshire. In olden times there had been a road from
Bakewell to Rowsley along the east side of the wall; but before Sir
George's seizin the road had been abandoned and the gate was not
used. It stood in a secluded, unfrequented spot, and Dorothy
thought herself very shrewd in choosing it for a
trysting-place.</p>
<p>But as I told you, one day the key was missed. It was of no
value or use, and at first nothing was thought of its loss; but
from time to time the fact that it could not be found was spoken of
as curious. All the servants had been questioned in vain, and the
loss of the key to Bowling Green Gate soon took on the dignity of a
mystery&mdash;a mystery soon to be solved, alas! to Dorothy's
undoing.</p>
<p>The afternoon of the day following the terrible scene between
Sir George and his daughter at the supper table, Dorothy rode forth
alone upon her mare Dolcy. From the window of my room in Eagle
Tower I saw her go down the west side of the Wye toward Rowsley. I
<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>ascended to the roof of the
tower, and from that elevation I saw her cross the river, and soon
she was lost to sight in the forest. At that time I knew nothing of
the new trysting-place, but I felt sure that Dorothy had gone out
to seek John. The sun shone brightly, and its gentle warmth enticed
me to remain upon the tower battlements, to muse, and to dream. I
fetched my pipe and tobacco from my room. I had been smoking at
intervals for several months, but had not entirely learned to like
the weed, because of a slight nausea which it invariably caused me
to feel. But I thought by practice now and again to inure myself to
the habit, which was then so new and fashionable among modish
gentlemen. While I smoked I mused upon the past and present, and
tried to peer into the future&mdash;a fruitless task wherein we
waste much valuable time; a vain striving, like Eve's, after
forbidden knowledge, which, should we possess it, would destroy the
little remnant of Eden still existing on earth. Could we look
forward only to our joys, a knowledge of the future might be good
to have; but imagine, if you can, the horror of anticipating evils
to come.</p>
<p>After a short time, a lotuslike dreaminess stole over me, and
past and future seemed to blend in a supreme present of contentment
and rest. Then I knew I had wooed and won Tobacco and that
thenceforth I had at hand an ever ready solace in time of trouble.
At the end of an hour my dreaming was disturbed by voices, which
came distinctly up to me from the base of the tower. I leaned over
the battlements to listen, and what I heard gave me alarm and
concern such as all the tobacco in the world could not assuage. I
looked down the dizzy heights of Eagle Tower and saw Sir George in
conversation with Ben Shaw, a woodman. I had not heard the words
first spoken between them.</p>
<p>"Ay, ay, Sir George," said Ben, "they be there, by<a name=
"Page_142" id="Page_142"></a> Bowling Green Gate, now. I saw them
twenty minutes since,&mdash;Mistress Vernon and a gentleman."</p>
<p>"Perhaps the gentleman is Sir Malcolm," answered my cousin. I
drew back from the battlements, and the woodman replied, "Perhaps
he be, but I doubt it."</p>
<p>There had been a partial reconciliation&mdash;sincere on Sir
George's part, but false and hollow on Dorothy's&mdash;which Madge
had brought about between father and daughter that morning. Sir
George, who was sober and repentant of his harshness, was inclined
to be tender to Dorothy, though he still insisted in the matter of
the Stanley marriage. Dorothy's anger had cooled, and cunning had
taken its place. Sir George had asked her to forgive him for the
hard words he had spoken, and she had again led him to believe that
she would be dutiful and obedient. It is hard to determine, as a
question of right and wrong, whether Dorothy is to be condemned or
justified in the woful deception she practised upon her father. To
use a plain, ugly word, she lied to him without hesitation or pain
of conscience. Still, we must remember that, forty years ago, girls
were frequently forced, regardless of cries and piteous agony, into
marriages to which death would have been preferable. They were
flogged into obedience, imprisoned and starved into obedience, and
alas! they were sometimes killed in the course of punishment for
disobedience by men of Sir George's school and temper. I could give
you at least one instance in which a fair girl met her death from
punishment inflicted by her father because she would not consent to
wed the man of his choice. Can we blame Dorothy if she would lie or
rob or do murder to avoid a fate which to her would have been worse
than death? When you find yourself condemning her, now or hereafter
in this history, if you are a man ask yourself this question: "If I
had a sweetheart in Dorothy's sad case, should I not wish her to do
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>as she did? Should I not wish,
if it were possible by any means, that she should save herself from
the worst of fates, and should save me from the agony of losing her
to such a man as Sir George had selected for Dorothy's husband? Is
it not a sin to disobey the law of self-preservation actively or
passively?" Answer these questions as you choose. As for myself, I
say God bless Dorothy for lying. Perhaps I am in error. Perhaps I
am not. I but tell you the story of Dorothy as it happened, and I
am a poor hand at solving questions of right and wrong where a
beautiful woman is concerned. To my thinking, she usually is in the
right. In any case, she is sure to have the benefit of the
doubt.</p>
<p>When Sir George heard the woodman's story, he started hurriedly
toward Bowling Green Gate.</p>
<p>Now I shall tell you of Dorothy's adventures after I saw her
cross the Wye.</p>
<p>When she reached the gate, John was waiting for her.</p>
<p>"Ah, Sir John, I am so glad you are here. That is, I am glad you
are here before I arrived&mdash;good even," said the girl,
confusedly. Her heart again was beating in a provoking manner, and
her breath would not come with ease and regularity. The rapid
progress of the malady with which she was afflicted or blessed was
plainly discernible since the last meeting with my friend, Sir
John. That is, it would have been plain to any one but John, whose
ailment had taken a fatal turn and had progressed to the
ante-mortem state of blindness. By the help of the stimulating hope
and fear which Dorothy's letter had brought to him, he had planned
an elaborate conversation, and had determined to speak decisive
words. He hoped to receive from her the answer for which he longed;
but his heart and breath seemed to have conspired with Dorothy to
make intercommunication troublesome.</p>
<p>"I received your gracious letter, Mistress Vernon, and I
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>thank you. I was&mdash;I
am&mdash;that is, my thanks are more than I&mdash;I can
express."</p>
<p>"So I see," said the girl, half amused at John's condition,
although it was but little worse than her own. This universal
malady, love, never takes its blind form in women. It opens their
eyes. Under its influence they can see the truth through a
millstone. The girl's heart jumped with joy when she saw John's
truth-telling manner, and composure quickly came to her relief,
though she still feigned confusion because she wished him to see
the truth in her as she had seen it in him. She well knew of his
blindness, and had almost begun to fear lest she would eventually
be compelled to tell him in words that which she so ardently wished
him to see for himself. She thought John was the blindest of his
sex; but she was, to a certain extent, mistaken. John was blind, as
you already know, but his reticence was not all due to a lack of
sight. He at least had reached the condition of a well-developed
hope. He hoped the girl cared for him. He would have fully believed
it had it not been for the difficulty he found in convincing
himself that a goddess like Dorothy could care for a man so
unworthy as himself. Most modest persons are self-respecting. That
was John's condition; he was not vain.</p>
<p>"Jennie brought me your letter also," said the girl, laughing
because she was happy, though her merriment somewhat disconcerted
John.</p>
<p>"It told me," she continued, "that you would come. I have it
here in my pocket&mdash;and&mdash;and the gate key." She determined
this time to introduce the key early in the engagement. "But I
feared you might not want to come." The cunning, the boldness, and
the humility of the serpent was in the girl. "That is, you know, I
thought&mdash;perhaps&mdash;that is, I feared that you might not
come. Your father might have been ill, or you might have changed
your mind after you wrote the letter."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>No," answered John, whose
face was beaming with joy. Here, truly, was a goddess who could
make the blind to see if she were but given a little time.</p>
<p>"Do you mean that your father is not ill, or that you did not
change your mind?" asked Dorothy, whose face, as it should have
been after such a speech, was bent low while she struggled with the
great iron key, entangled in the pocket of her gown.</p>
<p>"I mean that I have not changed my mind," said John, who felt
that the time to speak had come. "There has been no change in me
other than a new access of eagerness with every hour, and a new
longing to see you and to hear your voice."</p>
<p>Dorothy felt a great thrill pass through her breast, and she
knew that the reward of her labors was at hand.</p>
<p>"Certainly," said the self-complacent girl, hardly conscious of
her words, so great was the joyous tumult in her heart, "I should
have known."</p>
<p>There was another pause devoted to the key, with bended head.
"But&mdash;but you might have changed your mind," she continued,
"and I might not have known it, for, you see, I did not know your
former state of mind; you have never told me." Her tongue had led
her further than she had intended to go, and she blushed painfully,
and I think, considering her words, appropriately.</p>
<p>"My letter told you my state of mind. At least it told you of my
intention to come. I&mdash;I fear that I do not understand you,"
said John.</p>
<p>"I mean," she replied, with a saucy, fluttering little laugh as
she looked up from her conflict with the entangled key, "I mean
that&mdash;that you don't know what I mean. But here is the key at
last, and&mdash;and&mdash;you may, if you wish, come to this side
of the gate."</p>
<p>She stepped forward to unlock the gate with an air that seemed
to say, "Now, John, you shall have a clear field."<a name=
"Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></p>
<p>But to her surprise she found that the lock had been removed.
That discovery brought back to John his wandering wits.</p>
<p>"Mistress Dorothy," he cried in tones of alarm, "I must not
remain here. We are suspected and are sure to be discovered. Your
father has set a trap for us. I care not for myself, but I would
not bring upon you the trouble and distress which would surely
follow discovery. Let us quickly choose another place and time of
meeting. I pray you, sweet lady, meet me to-morrow at this time
near the white cliff back of Lathkil mill. I have that to say to
you which is the very blood of my heart. I must now leave you at
once."</p>
<p>He took her hand, and kissing it, started to leave through the
open gate.</p>
<p>The girl caught his arm to detain him. "Say it now, John, say it
now. I have dreamed of it by night and by day. You know all, and I
know all, and I long to hear from your lips the words that will
break down all barriers between us." She had been carried away by
the mad onrush of her passion. She was the iron, the seed, the
cloud, and the rain, and she spoke because she could not help
it.</p>
<p>"I will speak, Dorothy, God help me! God help me, I will speak!"
said John, as he caught the girl to his breast in a fierce embrace.
"I love you, I love you! God Himself only knows how deeply, how
passionately! I do not know. I cannot fathom its depths. With all
my heart and soul, with every drop of blood that pulses through my
veins, I love you&mdash;I adore you. Give me your lips, my beauty,
my Aphrodite, my queen!"</p>
<p>"There&mdash;they&mdash;are, John,&mdash;there they are. They
are&mdash;all yours&mdash;all yours&mdash;now! Oh, God! my blood is
on fire." She buried her face on his breast for shame, that he
might not see her burning eyes and her scarlet <a name="Page_147"
id="Page_147"></a>cheeks. Then after a time she cared not what he
saw, and she lifted her lips to his, a voluntary offering. The
supreme emotions of the moment drove all other consciousness from
their souls.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Dorothy, that you will be my wife. Tell me, tell me!"
cried John.</p>
<p>"I will, I will, oh, how gladly, how gladly!"</p>
<p>"Tell me that no power on earth can force you to marry Lord
Stanley. Tell me that you will marry no man but me; that you will
wait&mdash;wait for me till&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I will marry no man but you, John, no man but you," said the
girl, whisperingly. Her head was thrown back from his breast that
she might look into his eyes, and that he might see the truth in
hers. "I am all yours. But oh, John, I cannot wait&mdash;I cannot!
Do not ask me to wait. It would kill me. I wear the golden heart
you gave me, John," she continued, as she nestled closer in his
embrace. "I wear the golden heart always. It is never from me, even
for one little moment. I bear it always upon my heart, John. Here
it is." She drew from her breast the golden heart and kissed it.
Then she pressed it to his lips, and said: "I kiss it twenty times
in the day and in the night; ay, a hundred times. I do not know how
often; but now I kiss your real heart, John," and she kissed his
breast, and then stood tiptoe to lift her lips to his.</p>
<p>There was no room left now in John's heart for doubt that
Dorothy Vernon was his own forever and forever. She had convinced
him beyond the reach of fear or doubt. John forgot the lockless
gate. He forgot everything but Dorothy, and cruel time passed with
a rapidity of which they were unconscious. They were, however,
brought back to consciousness by hearing a long blast from the
forester's bugle, and John immediately retreated through the
gate.</p>
<p>Dorothy then closed the gate and hastily seated herself <a name=
"Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>upon a stone bench against the Haddon
side of the wall. She quickly assumed an attitude of listless
repose, and Dolcy, who was nibbling at the grass near by, doubtless
supposed that her mistress had come to Bowling Green Gate to rest
because it was a secluded place, and because she desired to be
alone.</p>
<p>Dorothy's attitude was not assumed one moment too soon, for
hardly was her gown arranged with due regard to carelessness when
Sir George's form rose above the crest of Bowling Green Hill. In a
few minutes he was standing in front of his daughter, red with
anger. Dorothy's face wore a look of calm innocence, which I
believe would have deceived Solomon himself, notwithstanding that
great man's experience with the sex. It did more to throw Sir
George off the scent than any words the girl could have spoken.</p>
<p>"Who has been with you?" demanded Sir George, angrily.</p>
<p>"When, father?" queried the girl, listlessly resting her head
against the wall.</p>
<p>"Now, this afternoon. Who has been with you? Ben Shaw said that
a man was here. He said that he saw a man with you less than half
an hour since."</p>
<p>That piece of information was startling to Dorothy, but no trace
of surprise was visible in her manner or in her voice. She turned
listlessly and brushed a dry leaf from her gown. Then she looked
calmly up into her father's face and said laconically, but to the
point:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Ben lied." To herself she said, "Ben shall also suffer."</p>
<p>"I do not believe that Ben lied," said Sir George. "I, myself,
saw a man go away from here."</p>
<p>That was crowding the girl into close quarters, but she did not
flinch.</p>
<p>"Which way did he go, father?" she asked, with a fine show of
carelessness in her manner, but with a feeling of <a name=
"Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>excruciating fear in her breast. She
well knew the wisdom of the maxim, "Never confess."</p>
<p>"He went northward," answered Sir George.</p>
<p>"Inside the wall?" asked Dorothy, beginning again to breathe
freely, for she knew that John had ridden southward.</p>
<p>"Inside the wall, of course," her father replied. "Do you
suppose I could see him through the stone wall? One should be able
to see through a stone wall to keep good watch on you."</p>
<p>"You might have thought you saw him through the wall," answered
the girl. "I sometimes think of late, father, that you are losing
your mind. You drink too much brandy, my dear father. Oh, wouldn't
it be dreadful if you were to lose your mind?" She rose as she
spoke, and going to her father began to stroke him gently with her
hand. She looked into his face with real affection; for when she
deceived him, she loved him best as a partial atonement for her
ill-doing.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't that be dreadful?" she continued, while Sir George
stood lost in bewilderment. "Wouldn't that be dreadful for my dear
old father to lose his mind? But I really think it must be coming
to pass. A great change has of late come over you, father. You have
for the first time in your life been unkind to me and suspicious.
Father, do you realize that you insult your daughter when you
accuse her of having been in this secluded place with a man? You
would punish another for speaking so against my fair name."</p>
<p>"But, Dorothy," Sir George replied, feeling as if he were in the
wrong, "Ben Shaw said that he saw you here with a man, and I saw a
man pass toward Bakewell. Who was he? I command you to tell me his
name."</p>
<p>Dorothy knew that her father must have seen a man near the gate,
but who he was she could not imagine. John surely was beyond the
wall and well out of sight on <a name="Page_150" id=
"Page_150"></a>his way to Rowsley before her father reached the
crest of Bowling Green Hill. But it was evident that Shaw had seen
John. Evidence that a man had been at the gate was too strong to be
successfully contradicted. Facts that cannot be successfully
contradicted had better be frankly admitted. Dorothy sought through
her mind for an admission that would not admit, and soon hit upon a
plan which, shrewd as it seemed to be, soon brought her to
grief.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you saw Cousin Malcolm," said Dorothy, as the result of
her mental search. "He passed here a little time since and stopped
for a moment to talk. Perhaps you saw Malcolm, father. You would
not find fault with me because he was here, would you?"</p>
<p>"Dorothy, my daughter," said Sir George, hesitatingly, "are you
telling me the truth?"</p>
<p>Then the fair girl lifted up her beautiful head, and standing
erect at her full height (it pains me to tell you this) said:
"Father, I am a Vernon. I would not lie."</p>
<p>Her manner was so truthlike that Sir George was almost
convinced.</p>
<p>He said, "I believe you."</p>
<p>Her father's confidence touched her keenly; but not to the point
of repentance, I hardly need say.</p>
<p>Dorothy then grew anxious to return to the Hall that she might
prepare me to answer whatever idle questions her father should put
to me. She took Dolcy's rein, and leading the mare with one hand
while she rested the other upon her father's arm, walked gayly
across Bowling Green down to the Hall, very happy because of her
lucky escape.</p>
<p>But a lie is always full of latent retribution.</p>
<p>I was sitting in the kitchen, dreamily watching the huge fire
when Dorothy and her father entered.</p>
<p>"Ah, Malcolm, are you here?" asked Sir George in a <a name=
"Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>peculiar tone of surprise for which I
could see no reason.</p>
<p>"I thought you were walking."</p>
<p>I was smoking. I took my pipe from my lips and said, "No, I am
helping old Bess and Jennie with supper."</p>
<p>"Have you not been walking?" asked Sir George.</p>
<p>There was an odd expression on his face when I looked up to him,
and I was surprised at his persistent inquiry concerning so trivial
a matter. But Sir George's expression, agitated as it was, still
was calm when compared with that of Dorothy, who stood a step or
two behind her father. Not only was her face expressive, but her
hands, her feet, her whole body were convulsed in an effort to
express something which, for the life of me, I could not
understand. Her wonderful eyes wore an expression, only too
readable, of terror and pleading. She moved her hands rapidly and
stamped her foot. During this pantomime she was forming words with
her lips and nodding her head affirmatively. Her efforts at
expression were lost upon me, and I could only respond with a blank
stare of astonishment. The expression on my face caused Sir George
to turn in the direction of my gaze, and he did so just in time to
catch Dorothy in the midst of a mighty pantomimic effort at mute
communication.</p>
<p>"Why in the devil's name are you making those grimaces?"
demanded Sir George.</p>
<p>"I wasn't making grimaces&mdash;I&mdash;I think I was about to
sneeze," replied Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Do you think I am blind?" stormed Sir George. "Perhaps I am
losing my mind? You are trying to tell Malcolm to say that he was
with you at Bowling Green Gate. Losing my mind, am I? Damme, I'll
show you that if I am losing my mind I have not lost my authority
in my own house."</p>
<p>"Now, father, what is all this storming about?" asked the girl,
coaxingly, as she boldly put her hands upon her <a name="Page_152"
id="Page_152"></a>father's shoulders and turned her face in all its
wondrous beauty and childish innocence of expression up to his.
"Ask Malcolm to tell you whatever you wish to know." She was sure
that her father had told me what she had been so anxious to
communicate, and she felt certain that I would not betray her. She
knew that I, whose only virtues were that I loved my friend and
despised a lie, would willingly bear false witness for her sake.
She was right. I had caught the truth of the situation from Sir
George, and I quickly determined to perjure my soul, if need be, to
help Dorothy. I cannot describe the influence this girl at times
exerted over me. When under its spell I seemed to be a creature of
her will, and my power to act voluntarily was paralyzed by a
strange force emanating from her marvellous vitality. I cannot
describe it. I tell you only the incontestable fact, and you may
make out of it whatever you can. I shall again in the course of
this history have occasion to speak of Dorothy's strange power, and
how it was exerted over no less a person than Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"Ask Malcolm," repeated the girl, leaning coaxingly upon her
father's breast. But I was saved from uttering the lie I was
willing to tell; for, in place of asking me, as his daughter had
desired, Sir George demanded excitedly of Dorothy, "What have you
in your pocket that strikes against my knee?"</p>
<p>"Mother of Heaven!" exclaimed Dorothy in a whisper, quickly
stepping back from her father and slowly lifting her skirt while
she reached toward her pocket. Her manner was that of one almost
bereft of consciousness by sudden fright, and an expression of
helplessness came over her face which filled my heart with pity.
She stood during a long tedious moment holding with one hand the
uplifted skirt, while with the other she clutched the key in her
pocket.</p>
<p>"What have you in your pocket?" demanded Sir George <a name=
"Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>with a terrible oath. "Bring it out,
girl. Bring it out, I tell you." Dorothy started to run from the
room, but her father caught her by the wrist and violently drew her
to him. "Bring it out, huzzy; it's the key to Bowling Green Gate.
Ah, I've lost my mind, have I? Blood of Christ! I have not lost my
mind yet, but I soon shall lose it at this rate," and he certainly
looked as if he would.</p>
<p>Poor frightened Dorothy was trying to take the key from her
pocket, but she was too slow to please her angry father, so he
grasped the gown and tore a great rent whereby the pocket was
opened from top to bottom. Dorothy still held the key in her hand,
but upon the floor lay a piece of white paper which had fallen out
through the rent Sir George had made in the gown. He divined the
truth as if by inspiration. The note, he felt sure, was from
Dorothy's unknown lover. He did not move nor speak for a time, and
she stood as if paralyzed by fear. She slowly turned her face from
her father to me, and in a low tone spoke my name, "Malcolm." Her
voice was hardly louder than a whisper, but so piteous a cry for
help I have never heard from human lips. Then she stooped,
intending to take the letter from the floor, and Sir George drew
back his arm as if he would strike her with his clenched hand. She
recoiled from him in terror, and he took up the letter, unfolded
it, and began to read:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Most gracious lady, I thank you for your letter, and with God's
help I will meet you at Bowling Green Gate&mdash;." The girl could
endure no more. She sprang with a scream toward her father and
tried to snatch the letter. Sir George drew back, holding firmly to
the paper. She followed him frantically, not to be thrown off, and
succeeded in clutching the letter. Sir George violently thrust her
from him. In the scuffle that ensued the letter was torn, and the
lower portion of the sheet remained in Dorothy's hand. She ran
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>to the fireplace, intending to
thrust the fragment into the fire, but she feared that her father
might rescue it from the ashes. She glanced at the piece of paper,
and saw that the part she had succeeded in snatching from her
father bore John's name. Sir George strode hurriedly across the
room toward her and she ran to me.</p>
<p>"Malcolm! Malcolm!" she cried in terror. The cry was like a
shriek. Then I saw her put the paper in her mouth. When she reached
me she threw herself upon my breast and clung to me with her arms
about my neck. She trembled as a single leaf among the thousands
that deck a full-leaved tree may tremble upon a still day, moved by
a convulsive force within itself. While she clung to me her
glorious bust rose and fell piteously, and her wondrous eyes
dilated and shone with a marvellous light. The expression was the
output of her godlike vitality, strung to its greatest tension. Her
face was pale, but terror dominated all the emotions it expressed.
Her fear, however, was not for herself. The girl, who would have
snapped her fingers at death, saw in the discovery which her father
was trying to make, loss to her of more than life. That which she
had possessed for less than one brief hour was about to be taken
from her. She had not enjoyed even one little moment alone in which
to brood her new-found love, and to caress the sweet thought of it.
The girl had but a brief instant of rest in my arms till Sir George
dragged her from me by his terrible strength.</p>
<p>"Where is the paper?" he cried in rage. "It contained the
fellow's signature."</p>
<p>"I have swallowed it, father, and you must cut me open to find
it. Doubtless that would be a pleasant task for you," answered
Dorothy, who was comparatively calm now that she knew her father
could not discover John's name. I believe Sir George in his frenzy
would have killed the girl had he then learned that the letter was
from John Manners.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>I command you to tell me
this fellow's name," said Sir George, with a calmness born of
tempest. Dorothy did not answer, and Sir George continued "I now
understand how you came by the golden heart. You lied to me and
told me that Malcolm had given it to you. Lie upon lie. In God's
name I swear that I would rather father a thief than a liar."</p>
<p>"I did give her the heart, Sir George," I said, interrupting
him. "It was my mother's." I had caught the lying infection. But
Sir George, in his violence, was a person to incite lies. He of
course had good cause for his anger. Dorothy had lied to him. Of
that there could be no doubt; but her deception was provoked by his
own conduct and by the masterful love that had come upon her. I
truly believe that prior to the time of her meeting with Manners
she had never spoken an untruth, nor since that time I also
believe, except when driven to do so by the same motive. Dorothy
was not a thief, but I am sure she would have stolen for the sake
of her lover. She was gentle and tender to a degree that only a
woman can attain; but I believe she would have done murder in cold
blood for the sake of her love. Some few women there are in whose
hearts God has placed so great an ocean of love that when it
reaches its flood all other attributes of heart and soul and mind
are ingulfed in its mighty flow. Of this rare class was
Dorothy.</p>
<p>"God is love," says the Book.</p>
<p>"The universe is God," says the philosopher. "Therefore," as the
mathematician would say, "love is the universe." To that
proposition Dorothy was a corollary.</p>
<p>The servants were standing open-eyed about us in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>"Let us go to the dining hall," I suggested. Sir George led the
way by the stone steps to the screens, and from the screens to the
small banquet hail, and I followed, leading Dorothy by the
hand.</p>
<p><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>The moment of respite from
her father's furious attack gave her time in which to collect her
scattered senses.</p>
<p>When we reached the banquet hall, and after I had closed the
door, Sir George turned upon his daughter, and with oath upon oath
demanded to know the name of her lover. Dorothy stood looking to
the floor and said nothing. Sir George strode furiously to and fro
across the room.</p>
<p>"Curse the day you were born, you wanton huzzy. Curse you! curse
you! Tell me the name of the man who wrote this letter," he cried,
holding toward her the fragment of paper. "Tell me his name or, I
swear it before God, I swear it upon my knighthood, I will have you
flogged in the upper court till you bleed. I would do it if you
were fifty times my child."</p>
<p>Then Dorothy awakened. The girl was herself again. Now it was
only for herself she had to fear.</p>
<p>Her heart kept saying, "This for his sake, this for his sake."
Out of her love came fortitude, and out of her fortitude came
action.</p>
<p>Her father's oath had hardly been spoken till the girl tore her
bodice from her shoulders. She threw the garment to the floor and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am ready for the whip, I am ready. Who is to do the deed,
father, you or the butcher? It must be done. You have sworn it, and
I swear before God and by my maidenhood that I will not tell you
the name of the man who wrote the letter. I love him, and before I
will tell you his name or forego his love for me, or before I will
abate one jot or tittle of my love for him, I will gladly die by
the whip in your hand. I am ready for the whip, father. I am ready.
Let us have it over quickly."</p>
<p>The girl, whose shoulders were bare, took a few steps toward the
door leading to the upper court, but Sir George did not move. I was
deeply affected by the terrible scene, and I determined to prevent
the flogging if to do so should <a name="Page_157" id=
"Page_157"></a>cost Sir George's life at my hands. I would have
killed him ere he should have laid a single lash of the whip upon
Dorothy's back.</p>
<p>"Father," continued the terrible girl, "are you not going to
flog me? Remember your oaths. Surely you would not be forsworn
before God and upon your knighthood. A forsworn Christian? A
forsworn knight? A forsworn Vernon? The lash, father, the
lash&mdash;I am eager for it."</p>
<p>Sir George stood in silence, and Dorothy continued to move
toward the door. Her face was turned backward over her shoulder to
her father, and she whispered the words, "Forsworn, forsworn,
forsworn!"</p>
<p>As she put her hand on the latch the piteous old man held forth
his arms toward her and in a wail of agony cried: "Doll! Doll! My
daughter! My child! God help me!"</p>
<p>He covered his face with his hands, his great form shook for a
moment as the tree trembles before the fall, and he fell prone to
the floor sobbing forth the anguish of which his soul was full.</p>
<p>In an instant Dorothy was by her father's side holding his head
upon her lap. She covered his face with her kisses, and while the
tears streamed from her eyes she spoke incoherent words of love and
repentance.</p>
<p>"I will tell you all, father; I will tell you all. I will give
him up; I will see him never again. I will try not to love him. Oh,
father, forgive me, forgive me. I will never again deceive you so
long as I live."</p>
<p>Truly the fate of an overoath is that it shall be broken. When
one swears to do too much, one performs too little.</p>
<p>I helped Sir George rise to his feet.</p>
<p>Dorothy, full of tenderness and in tears, tried to take his
hand, but he repulsed her rudely, and uttering terrible oaths
coupled with her name quitted the room with tottering steps.</p>
<p>When her father had gone Dorothy stood in revery for <a name=
"Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>a little time, and then looking toward
the door through which her father had just passed, she spoke as if
to herself: "He does not know. How fortunate!"</p>
<p>"But you said you would tell him," I suggested. "You said you
would give him up."</p>
<p>Dorothy was in a deep revery. She took her bodice from the floor
and mechanically put it on.</p>
<p>"I know I said I would tell my father, and I offered to
give&mdash;give him up," she replied; "but I will do neither.
Father would not meet my love with love. He would not forgive me,
nor would he accept my repentance when it was he who should have
repented. I was alarmed and grieved for father's sake when I said
that I would tell him about&mdash;about John, and would give him
up." She was silent and thoughtful for a little time. "Give him
up?" she cried defiantly. "No, not for my soul; not for ten
thousand thousand souls. When my father refused my love, he threw
away the only opportunity he shall ever have to learn from me
John's name. That I swear, and I shall never be forsworn. I asked
father's forgiveness when he should have begged for mine. Whip me
in the courtyard, would he, till I should bleed! Yet I was willing
to forgive him, and he would not accept my forgiveness. I was
willing to forego John, who is more than life to me; but my father
would not accept my sacrifice. Truly will I never be so great a
fool the second time. Malcolm, I will not remain here to be the
victim of another insult such as my father put upon me to-day.
There is no law, human or divine, that gives to a parent the right
to treat his daughter as my father has used me. Before this day my
conscience smote me when I deceived him, and I suffered pain if I
but thought of my father. But now, thanks to his cruelty, I may be
happy without remorse. Malcolm, if you betray me, I will&mdash;I
will kill you if I must follow you over the world to do it."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>Do you think that I
deserve that threat from you, Dorothy?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, no, my dear friend, forgive me. I trust you," and she
caught up my hand and kissed it gently.</p>
<p>Dorothy and I remained in the banquet hail, seated upon the
stone bench under the blazoned window.</p>
<p>Soon Sir George returned, closely followed by two men, one of
whom bore manacles such as were used to secure prisoners in the
dungeon. Sir George did not speak. He turned to the men and
motioned with his hand toward Dorothy. I sprang to my feet,
intending to interfere by force, if need be, to prevent the
outrage; but before I could speak Lady Crawford hurriedly entered
the hall and ran to Sir George's side.</p>
<p>"Brother," she said, "old Bess has just told me that you have
given orders for Dorothy's confinement in the dungeon. I could not
believe Bess; but these men with irons lead me to suspect that you
really intend.&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do not interfere in affairs that do not concern you," replied
Sir George, sullenly.</p>
<p>"But this does concern me greatly," said Aunt Dorothy, "and if
you send Doll to the dungeon, Madge and I will leave your house and
will proclaim your act to all England."</p>
<p>"The girl has disobeyed me and has lied to me, and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I care not what she has done, I shall leave your house and
disown you for my brother if you perpetrate this outrage upon my
niece. She is dear to me as if she were my own child. Have I not
brought her up since babyhood? If you carry out this order,
brother, I will leave Haddon Hall forever."</p>
<p>"And I'll go with her," cried old Bess, who stood at the door of
the screens.</p>
<p>"And I, too," said Dawson, who was one of the men who had
entered with Sir George.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>And I," cried the other
man, throwing the manacles to the floor, "I will leave your
service."</p>
<p>Sir George took up the manacles and moved toward Dorothy.</p>
<p>"You may all go, every cursed one of you. I rule my own house,
and I will have no rebels in it. When I have finished with this
perverse wench, I'll not wait for you to go. I'll drive you all out
and you may go to&mdash;"</p>
<p>He was approaching Dorothy, but I stepped in front of him.</p>
<p>"This must not be, Sir George," said I, sternly. "I shall not
leave Haddon Hall, and I fear you not. I shall remain here to
protect your daughter and you from your own violence. You cannot
put me out of Haddon Hall; I will not go."</p>
<p>"Why cannot I put you out of Haddon Hail?" retorted Sir George,
whose rage by that time was frightful to behold.</p>
<p>"Because, sir, I am a better man and a better swordsman than you
are, and because you have not on all your estates a servant nor a
retainer who will not join me against you when I tell them the
cause I champion."</p>
<p>Dawson and his fellow stepped to my side significantly, and Sir
George raised the iron manacles as if intending to strike me. I did
not move. At the same moment Madge entered the room.</p>
<p>"Where is my uncle?" she asked.</p>
<p>Old Bess led her to Sir George. She spoke not a word, but placed
her arms gently about his neck and drew his face down to hers. Then
she kissed him softly upon the lips and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My uncle has never in all his life spoken in aught but kindness
to me, and now I beg him to be kind to Dorothy."</p>
<p>The heavy manacles fell clanking to the floor. Sir George placed
his hand caressingly upon Madge's head and turned from Dorothy.</p>
<p><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>Lady Crawford then
approached her brother and put her hand upon his arm,
saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Come with me, George, that I may speak to you in private."</p>
<p>She moved toward the door by which she had entered, and Madge
quietly took her uncle's hand and led him after Lady Crawford.
Within five minutes Sir George, Aunt Dorothy, and Madge returned to
the room.</p>
<p>"Dorothy?" said Madge in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Here I am, Madge," murmured Dorothy, who was sitting on the
bench by the blazoned window. Madge walked gropingly over to her
cousin and sat by her side, taking her hand. Then Lady Crawford
spoke to Dorothy:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Your father wishes me to say that you must go to your
apartments in Entrance Tower, and that you shall not leave them
without his consent. He also insists that I say to you if you make
resistance or objection to this decree, or if you attempt to
escape, he will cause you to be manacled and confined in the
dungeon, and that no persuasion upon our part will lead him from
his purpose."</p>
<p>"Which shall it be?" asked Sir George, directing his question to
Lady Crawford.</p>
<p>Dorothy lifted her eyebrows, bit the corner of her lip, shrugged
her shoulders, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Indeed, it makes no difference to me where you send me, father;
I am willing to do whatever will give you the greatest happiness.
If you consult my wishes, you will have me whipped in the courtyard
till I bleed. I should enjoy that more than anything else you can
do. Ah, how tender is the love of a father! It passeth
understanding."</p>
<p>"Come to your apartments, Dorothy," said Lady Crawford, anxious
to separate the belligerents. "I have given your father my word of
honor that I will guard you and will keep you prisoner in your
rooms. Do you not pity me? I gave my promise only to save you from
the <a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>dungeon, and painful as
the task will be, I will keep my word to your father."</p>
<p>"Which shall it be, father?" asked Dorothy. "You shall finish
the task you began. I shall not help you in your good work by
making choice. You shall choose my place of imprisonment. Where
shall it be? Shall I go to my rooms or to the dungeon?"</p>
<p>"Go to your rooms," answered Sir George, "and let me never
see&mdash;" but Sir George did not finish the sentence. He
hurriedly left the hall, and Dorothy cheerfully went to
imprisonment in Entrance Tower.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a><a name="Page_163"
id="Page_163"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2>MALCOLM No. 2</h2>
<p>Sir George had done a bad day's work. He had hardened Dorothy's
heart against himself and had made it more tender toward John.
Since her father had treated her so cruelly, she felt she was at
liberty to give her heart to John without stint. So when once she
was alone in her room the flood-gates of her heart were opened, and
she poured forth the ineffable tenderness and the passionate
longings with which she was filled. With solitude came the memory
of John's words and John's kisses. She recalled every movement,
every word, every tone, every sensation. She gave her soul
unbridled license to feast with joyous ecstasy upon the thrilling
memories. All thoughts of her father's cruelty were drowned in a
sea of bliss. She forgot him. In truth, she forgot everything but
her love and her lover. That evening, after she had assisted Madge
to prepare for bed, as was her custom, Dorothy stood before her
mirror making her toilet for the night. In the flood of her newly
found ecstasy she soon forgot that Madge was in the room.</p>
<p>Dorothy stood before her mirror with her face near to its
polished surface, that she might scrutinize every feature, and, if
possible, verify John's words.</p>
<p>"He called me 'my beauty' twice," she thought, "and 'my
Aphrodite' once." Then her thoughts grew into unconscious words,
and she spoke aloud:&mdash;</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>I wish he could see me
now." And she blushed at the thought, as she should have done. "He
acted as if he meant all he said," she thought. "I know he meant
it. I trust him entirely. But if he should change? Holy Mother, I
believe I should die. But I do believe him. He would not lie, even
though he is not a Vernon."</p>
<p>With thoughts of the scene between herself and her father at the
gate, there came a low laugh, half of amusement, half of
contentment, and the laugh meant a great deal that was to be
regretted; it showed a sad change in Dorothy's heart. But yesterday
the memory of her deceit would have filled her with grief. To-night
she laughed at it. Ah, Sir George! Pitiable old man! While your
daughter laughs, you sigh and groan and moan, and your heart aches
with pain and impotent rage. Even drink fails to bring comfort to
you. I say impotent rage, because Dorothy is out of your reach, and
as surely as the sun rises in the east she is lost to you forever.
The years of protection and tender love which you have given to her
go for nothing. Now comes the son of your mortal enemy, and you are
but an obstruction in her path. Your existence is forgotten while
she revels in the memory of his words, his embraces, and his lips.
She laughs while you suffer, in obedience to the fate that Heaven
has decreed for those who bring children into this world.</p>
<p>Who is to blame for the pitiable mite which children give in
return for a parent's flood of love? I do not know, but of this I
am sure: if parents would cease to feel that they own their
children in common with their horses, their estates, and their
cattle; if they would not, as many do in varying degrees, treat
their children as their property, the return of love would be far
more adequate than it is.</p>
<p>Dorothy stood before her mirror plaiting her hair. Her head was
turned backward a little to one side that she <a name="Page_165"
id="Page_165"></a>might more easily reach the great red golden
skein. In that entrancing attitude the reflection of the nether lip
of which John had spoken so fondly came distinctly to Dorothy's
notice. She paused in the braiding of her hair and held her face
close to the mirror that she might inspect the lip, whose beauty
John had so ardently admired. She turned her face from one side to
the other that she might view it from all points, and then she
thrust it forward with a pouting movement that would have set the
soul of a mummy pulsing if he had ever been a man. She stood for a
moment in contemplation of the full red lip, and then resting her
hands upon the top of the mirror table leaned forward and kissed
its reflected image.</p>
<p>Again forgetfulness fell upon her and her thoughts grew into
words.</p>
<p>"He was surely right concerning my lower lip," she said,
speaking to herself. Then without the least apparent relevance, "He
had been smoking." Again her words broke her revery, and she took
up the unfinished braid of hair. When she did so, she caught a
glimpse of her arm which was as perfectly rounded as the fairest
marble of Phidias. She stretched the arm to its full length that
the mirror might reflect its entire beauty. Again she thought
aloud: "I wish he could see my arm. Perhaps some day&mdash;" But
the words ceased, and in their place came a flush that spread from
her hair to her full white throat, and she quickly turned the
mirror away so that even it should not behold her beauty.</p>
<p>You see after all is told Dorothy was modest.</p>
<p>She finished her toilet without the aid of her mirror; but
before she extinguished the candle she stole one more fleeting
glance at its polished surface, and again came the thought,
"Perhaps some day&mdash;" Then she covered the candle, and amid
enfolding darkness lay down beside Madge, full of thoughts and
sensations that made her <a name="Page_166" id=
"Page_166"></a>tremble; for they were strange to her, and she knew
not what they meant.</p>
<p>Dorothy thought that Madge was asleep, but after a few minutes
the latter said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Tell me, Dorothy, who was on fire?"</p>
<p>"Who was on fire?" asked Dorothy in surprise. "What do you mean,
Madge?"</p>
<p>"I hope they have not been trying to burn any one," said
Madge.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" again asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>"You said 'He had been smoking,'" responded Madge.</p>
<p>"Oh," laughed Dorothy, "that is too comical. Of course not, dear
one. I was speaking of&mdash;of a man who had been smoking tobacco,
as Malcolm does." Then she explained the process of tobacco
smoking.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know," answered Madge. "I saw Malcolm's pipe. That is, I
held it in my hands for a moment while he explained to me its
use."</p>
<p>Silence ensued for a moment, and Madge again spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What was it he said about your lower lip, and who was he? I did
not learn why Uncle George wished to confine you in the dungeon. I
am so sorry that this trouble has come upon you."</p>
<p>"Trouble, Madge?" returned Dorothy. "Truly, you do not
understand. No trouble has come upon me. The greatest happiness of
my life has come to pass. Don't pity me. Envy me. My happiness is
so sweet and so great that it frightens me."</p>
<p>"How can you be happy while your father treats you so cruelly?"
asked Madge.</p>
<p>"His conduct makes it possible for my happiness to be complete,"
returned Dorothy. "If he were kind to me, I should be unhappy, but
his cruelty leaves me free to be as happy as I may. For my
imprisonment in this room I care not a farthing. It does not
trouble me, for when I wish <a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>to
see&mdash;see him again, I shall do so. I don't know at this time
just how I shall effect it; but be sure, sweet one, I shall find a
way." There was no doubt in Madge's mind that Dorothy would find a
way.</p>
<p>"Who is he, Dorothy? You may trust me. Is he the gentleman whom
we met at Derby-town?"</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Dorothy, "he is Sir John Manners."</p>
<p>"Dorothy!" exclaimed Madge in tones of fear.</p>
<p>"It could not be worse, could it, Madge?" said Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dorothy!" was the only response.</p>
<p>"You will not betray me?" asked Dorothy, whose alarm made her
suspicious.</p>
<p>"You know whether or not I will betray you," answered Madge.</p>
<p>"Indeed, I know, else I should not have told you my secret. Oh,
you should see him, Madge; he is the most beautiful person living.
The poor soft beauty of the fairest woman grows pale beside him.
You cannot know how wonderfully beautiful a man may be. You have
never seen one."</p>
<p>"Yes, I have seen many men, and I well remember their
appearance. I was twelve years old, you know, when I lost my
sight."</p>
<p>"But, Madge," said Dorothy, out of the fulness of her newly
acquired knowledge, "a girl of twelve cannot see a man."</p>
<p>"No woman sees with her eyes the man whom she loves," answered
Madge, quietly.</p>
<p>"How does she see him?" queried Dorothy.</p>
<p>"With her heart."</p>
<p>"Have you, too, learned that fact?" asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>Madge hesitated for a moment and murmured "Yes."</p>
<p>"Who is he, dear one?" whispered Dorothy.</p>
<p>"I may not tell even you, Dorothy," replied Madge,<a name=
"Page_168" id="Page_168"></a> "because it can come to nothing. The
love is all on my part."</p>
<p>Dorothy insisted, but Madge begged her not to ask for her
secret.</p>
<p>"Please don't even make a guess concerning him," said Madge. "It
is my shame and my joy."</p>
<p>It looked as if this malady which had fallen upon Dorothy were
like the plague that infects a whole family if one but catch
it.</p>
<p>Dorothy, though curious, was generous, and remained content with
Madge's promise that she should be the first one to hear the sweet
story if ever the time should come to tell it.</p>
<p>"When did you see him?" asked Madge, who was more willing to
receive than to impart intelligence concerning affairs of the
heart.</p>
<p>"To-day," answered Dorothy. Then she told Madge about the scenes
at the gate and described what had happened between her and Sir
George in the kitchen and banquet hall.</p>
<p>"How could you tell your father such a falsehood?" asked Madge
in consternation.</p>
<p>"It was very easy. You see I had to do it. I never lied until
recently. But oh, Madge, this is a terrible thing to come upon a
girl!" "This" was somewhat indefinite, but Madge understood, and
perhaps it will be clear to you what Dorothy meant. The girl
continued: "She forgets all else. It will drive her to do anything,
however wicked. For some strange cause, under its influence she
does not feel the wrong she does. It acts upon a girl's sense of
right and wrong as poppy juice acts on pain. Before it came upon me
in&mdash;in such terrible force, I believe I should have become ill
had I told my father a falsehood. I might have equivocated, or I
might have evaded the truth in some slight degree, but I could not
have told a lie. But now it is as easy as winking."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>And I fear, Dorothy,"
responded Madge, "that winking is very easy for you."</p>
<p>"Yes," answered candid Dorothy with a sigh.</p>
<p>"It must be a very great evil," said Madge, deploringly.</p>
<p>"One might well believe so," answered Dorothy, "but it is not.
One instinctively knows it to be the essence of all that is
good."</p>
<p>Madge asked, "Did Sir John tell you that&mdash;that
he&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Dorothy, covering her face even from the flickering
rays of the rushlight.</p>
<p>"Did you tell him?"</p>
<p>"Yes," came in reply from under the coverlet.</p>
<p>After a short silence Dorothy uncovered her face.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said boldly, "I told him plainly; nor did I feel
shame in so doing. It must be that this strange love makes one
brazen. You, Madge, would die with shame had you sought any man as
I have sought John. I would not for worlds tell you how bold and
over-eager I have been."</p>
<p>"Oh, Dorothy!" was all the answer Madge gave.</p>
<p>"You would say 'Oh, Dorothy,' many times if you knew all."
Another pause ensued, after which Madge asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"How did you know he had been smoking?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I tasted it," responded Dorothy.</p>
<p>"How could you taste it? I hope you did not smoke?" returned
Madge in wonderment.</p>
<p>Dorothy smothered a little laugh, made two or three vain
attempts to explain, tenderly put her arms about Madge's neck and
kissed her.</p>
<p>"Oh, Dorothy, that certainly was wrong," returned Madge,
although she had some doubts in her own mind upon the point.</p>
<p>"Well, if it is wrong," answered Dorothy, sighing, "I don't care
to live."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>Dorothy, I fear you are an
immodest girl," said Madge.</p>
<p>"I fear I am, but I don't care&mdash;John, John, John!"</p>
<p>"How came he to speak of your lower lip?" asked Madge. "It
certainly is very beautiful; but how came he to speak of it?"</p>
<p>"It was after&mdash;after&mdash;once," responded Dorothy.</p>
<p>"And your arm," continued remorseless Madge, "how came he to
speak of it? You surely did not&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no, Madge; I hope you do not think I would show him my arm.
I have not come to that. I have a poor remnant of modesty left; but
the Holy Mother only knows how long it will last. No, he did not
speak of my arm."</p>
<p>"You spoke of your arm when you were before the mirror,"
responded Madge, "and you said, 'Perhaps some day&mdash;'"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't, Madge. Please spare me. I indeed fear I am very
wicked. I will say a little prayer to the Virgin to-night. She will
hear me, even If I am wicked; and she will help me to become good
and modest again."</p>
<p>The girls went to sleep, and Dorothy dreamed "John, John, John,"
and slumbered happily.</p>
<p>That part of the building of Haddon Hall which lies to the
northward, west of the kitchen, consists of rooms according to the
following plan:&mdash;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="v170" id="v170"></a> <img src=
"images/v170.jpg" alt="" title="" /></div>
<p>The two rooms in Entrance Tower over the great doors at the
northwest corner of Haddon Hall were occupied by Dorothy and Madge.
The west room overlooking the Wye was their parlor. The next room
to the east was their bedroom. The room next their bedroom was
occupied by Lady Crawford. Beyond that was Sir George's bedroom,
and east of his room was one occupied by the pages and two
retainers. To enter Dorothy's apartments one must pass through all
the other rooms I have mentioned. Her windows were twenty-five feet
from the ground and were <a name="Page_171" id=
"Page_171"></a>barred with iron. After Dorothy's sentence of
imprisonment, Lady Crawford, or some trusted person in her place,
was always on guard in Aunt Dorothy's room to prevent Dorothy's
escape, and guards were also stationed in the retainer's room for
the same purpose. I tell you this that you may understand the
difficulties Dorothy would have to overcome before she could see
John, as she declared to Madge she would. But my opinion is that
there are no limits to the resources of a wilful girl. Dorothy saw
Manners. The plan she conceived to bring about the desired end was
so seemingly impossible, and her execution of it was so adroit and
daring, that I believe it will of itself Interest you in the
telling, aside from the bearing it has upon this history. No sane
man would have deemed it possible, but this wilful girl carried it
to fruition. She saw no chance of failure. To her it seemed a
simple, easy matter. Therefore she said with confidence and truth,
"I will see him when I wish to."</p>
<p>Let me tell you of it.</p>
<p>During Dorothy's imprisonment I spent an hour or two each
evening with her and Madge at their parlor in the tower. The
windows of the room, as I have told you, faced westward,
overlooking the Wye, and disclosed the beautiful, undulating
scenery of Overhaddon Hill in the distance.</p>
<p>One afternoon when Madge was not present Dorothy asked me to
bring her a complete suit of my garments,&mdash;boots, hose,
trunks, waistcoat, and doublet. I laughed, and asked her what she
wanted with them, but she refused to tell me. She insisted,
however, and I promised to fetch the garments to her. Accordingly
the next evening I delivered the bundle to her hands. Within a week
she returned them all, saving the boots. Those she kept&mdash;for
what reason I could not guess.</p>
<p>Lady Crawford, by command of Sir George, carried in <a name=
"Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>her reticule the key of the door which
opened from her own room into Sir George's apartments, and the door
was always kept locked.</p>
<p>Dorothy had made several attempts to obtain possession of the
key, with intent, I believe, of making a bold dash for liberty. But
Aunt Dorothy, mindful of Sir George's wrath and fearing him above
all men, acted faithfully her part of gaoler. She smiled, half in
sadness, when she told me of the girl's simplicity in thinking she
could hoodwink a person of Lady Crawford's age, experience, and
wisdom. The old lady took great pride in her own acuteness. The
distasteful task of gaoler, however, pained good Aunt Dorothy,
whose simplicity was, in truth, no match for Dorothy's
love-quickened cunning. But Aunt Dorothy's sense of duty and her
fear of Sir George impelled her to keep good and conscientious
guard.</p>
<p>One afternoon near the hour of sunset I knocked for admission at
Lady Crawford's door. When I had entered she locked the door
carefully after me, and replaced the key in the reticule which hung
at her girdle.</p>
<p>I exchanged a few words with her Ladyship, and entered Dorothy's
bedroom, where I left my cloak, hat, and sword. The girls were in
the parlor. When I left Lady Crawford she again took her chair near
the candle, put on her great bone-rimmed spectacles, and was soon
lost to the world in the pages of "Sir Philip de Comynges." The
dear old lady was near-sighted and was slightly deaf. Dorothy's
bedroom, like Lady Crawford's apartments, was in deep shadow. In it
there was no candle.</p>
<p>My two fair friends were seated in one of the west windows
watching the sunset. They rose, and each gave me her hand and
welcomed me with the rare smiles I had learned to expect from them.
I drew a chair near to the window and we talked and laughed
together merrily for a few minutes. After a little time Dorothy
excused her<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>self, saying that
she would leave Madge and me while she went into the bedroom to
make a change in her apparel.</p>
<p>Madge and I sat for a few minutes at the window, and I said,
"You have not been out to-day for exercise."</p>
<p>I had ridden to Derby with Sir George and had gone directly on
my return to see my two young friends. Sir George had not
returned.</p>
<p>"Will you walk with me about the room?" I asked. My real reason
for making the suggestion was that I longed to clasp her hand, and
to feel its velvety touch, since I should lead her if we
walked.</p>
<p>She quickly rose in answer to my invitation and offered me her
hand. As we walked to and fro a deep, sweet contentment filled my
heart, and I felt that any words my lips could coin would but mar
the ineffable silence.</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the soft light of that gloaming as the
darkening red rays of the sinking sun shot through the panelled
window across the floor and illumined the tapestry upon the
opposite wall.</p>
<p>The tapestries of Haddon Hall are among the most beautiful in
England, and the picture upon which the sun's rays fell was that of
a lover kneeling at the feet of his mistress. Madge and I passed
and repassed the illumined scene, and while it was softly fading
into shadow a great flood of tender love for the girl whose soft
hand I held swept over my heart. It was the noblest motive I had
ever felt.</p>
<p>Moved by an impulse I could not resist, I stopped in our walk,
and falling to my knee pressed her hand ardently to my lips. Madge
did not withdraw her hand, nor did she attempt to raise me. She
stood in passive silence. The sun's rays had risen as the sun had
sunk, and the light was falling like a holy radiance from the gates
of paradise upon the girl's head. I looked upward, and never in my
eyes had woman's face appeared so fair and saintlike.<a name=
"Page_174" id="Page_174"></a> She seemed to see me and to feel the
silent outpouring of my affection. I rose to my feet, and clasping
both her hands spoke only her name "Madge."</p>
<p>She answered simply, "Malcolm, is it possible?" And her face,
illumined by the sunlight and by the love-god, told me all else.
Then I gently took her to my arms and kissed her lips again and
again and again, and Madge by no sign nor gesture said me nay. She
breathed a happy sigh, her head fell upon my breast, and all else
of good that the world could offer compared with her was dross to
me.</p>
<p>We again took our places by the window, since now I might hold
her hand without an excuse. By the window we sat, speaking little,
through the happiest hour of my I life. How dearly do I love to
write about it, and to lave my soul in the sweet aromatic essence
of its memory. But my rhapsodies must have an end.</p>
<p>When Dorothy left me with Madge at the window she entered her
bedroom and quickly arrayed herself in garments which were
facsimiles of those I had lent her. Then she put her feet into my
boots and donned my hat and cloak. She drew my gauntleted gloves
over her hands, buckled my sword to her slim waist, pulled down the
broad rim of my soft beaver hat over her face, and turned up the
collar of my cloak. Then she adjusted about her chin and upper lip
a black chin beard and moustachio, which she had in some manner
contrived to make, and, in short, prepared to enact the role of
Malcolm Vernon before her watchful gaoler, Aunt Dorothy.</p>
<p>While sitting silently with Madge I heard the clanking of my
sword against the oak floor in Dorothy's bedroom. I supposed she
had been toying with it and had let it fall. She was much of a
child, and nothing could escape her curiosity. Then I heard the
door open into Aunt Dorothy's apartments. I whispered to Madge
requesting her to remain silently by the window, and then I stepped
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>softly over to the door
leading into the bedroom. I noiselessly opened the door and
entered. From my dark hiding-place in Dorothy's bedroom I witnessed
a scene in Aunt Dorothy's room which filled me with wonder and
suppressed laughter. Striding about in the shadow-darkened portions
of Lady Crawford's apartment was my other self, Malcolm No. 2,
created from the flesh and substance of Dorothy Vernon.</p>
<p>The sunlight was yet abroad, though into Lady Crawford's room
its slanting rays but dimly entered at that hour, and the apartment
was in deep shadow, save for the light of one flickering candle,
close to the flame of which the old lady was holding the pages of
the book she was laboriously perusing.</p>
<p>The girl held her hand over her mouth trumpet-wise that her
voice might be deepened, and the swagger with which she strode
about the room was the most graceful and ludicrous movement I ever
beheld. I wondered if she thought she was imitating my walk, and I
vowed that if her step were a copy of mine, I would straightway
amend my pace.</p>
<p>"What do you read, Lady Crawford?" said my cloak and hat, in
tones that certainly were marvellously good imitations of my
voice.</p>
<p>"What do you say, Malcolm?" asked the deaf old lady, too gentle
to show the ill-humor she felt because of the interruption to her
reading.</p>
<p>"I asked what do you read?" repeated Dorothy.</p>
<p>"The 'Chronicle of Sir Philip de Comynges,'" responded Lady
Crawford. "Have you read it? It is a rare and interesting
history."</p>
<p>"Ah, indeed, it is a rare book, a rare book. I have read it many
times." There was no need for that little fabrication, and it
nearly brought Dorothy into trouble.</p>
<p>"What part of the 'Chronicle' do you best like?" asked<a name=
"Page_176" id="Page_176"></a> Aunt Dorothy, perhaps for lack of
anything else to say. Here was trouble already for Malcolm No.
2.</p>
<p>"That is hard for me to say. I so well like it all.
Perhaps&mdash;ah&mdash;perhaps I prefer the&mdash;the ah&mdash;the
middle portion."</p>
<p>"Ah, you like that part which tells the story of Mary of
Burgundy," returned Aunt Dorothy. "Oh, Malcolm, I know upon what
theme you are always thinking&mdash;the ladies, the ladies."</p>
<p>"Can the fair Lady Crawford chide me for that?" my second self
responded in a gallant style of which I was really proud. "She who
has caused so much of that sort of thought surely must know that a
gentleman's mind cannot be better employed than&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Malcolm, you are incorrigible. But it is well for a gentleman
to keep in practice in such matters, even though he have but an old
lady to practise on."</p>
<p>"They like it, even if it be only practice, don't they?" said
Dorothy, full of the spirit of mischief.</p>
<p>"I thank you for nothing, Sir Malcolm Vernon," retorted Aunt
Dorothy with a toss of her head. "I surely don't value your
practice, as you call it, one little farthing's worth."</p>
<p>But Malcolm No. 2, though mischievously inclined, was much
quicker of wit than Malcolm No. 1, and she easily extricated
herself.</p>
<p>"I meant that gentlemen like it, Lady Crawford."</p>
<p>"Oh!" replied Lady Crawford, again taking up her book. "I have
been reading Sir Philip's account of the death of your fair Mary of
Burgundy. Do you remember the cause of her death?"</p>
<p>Malcolm No. 2, who had read Sir Philip so many times, was
compelled to admit that he did not remember the cause of Mary's
death.</p>
<p>"You did not read the book with attention," replied Lady<a name=
"Page_177" id="Page_177"></a> Crawford. "Sir Philip says that Mary
of Burgundy died from an excess of modesty."</p>
<p>"That disease will never depopulate England," was the answer
that came from my garments, much to my chagrin.</p>
<p>"Sir Malcolm," exclaimed the old lady, "I never before heard so
ungallant a speech from your lips."&mdash;"And," thought I, "she
never will hear its like from me."</p>
<p>"Modesty," continued Lady Crawford, "may not be valued so highly
by young women nowadays as it was in the time of my youth,
but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am sure it is not," interrupted Dorothy.</p>
<p>"But," continued Lady Crawford, "the young women of England are
modest and seemly in their conduct, and they do not deserve to be
spoken of in ungallant jest."</p>
<p>I trembled lest Dorothy should ruin my reputation for
gallantry.</p>
<p>"Do you not," said Lady Crawford, "consider Dorothy and Madge to
be modest, well-behaved maidens?"</p>
<p>"Madge! Ah, surely she is all that a maiden should be. She is a
saint, but as to Dorothy&mdash;well, my dear Lady Crawford, I
predict another end for her than death from modesty. I thank Heaven
the disease in its mild form does not kill. Dorothy has it mildly,"
then under her breath, "if at all."</p>
<p>The girl's sense of humor had vanquished her caution, and for
the moment it caused her to forget even the reason for her
disguise.</p>
<p>"You do not speak fairly of your cousin Dorothy," retorted Lady
Crawford. "She is a modest girl, and I love her deeply."</p>
<p>"Her father would not agree with you," replied Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not," responded the aunt. "Her father's conduct causes
me great pain and grief."</p>
<p>"It also causes me pain," said Dorothy, sighing.</p>
<p>"But, Malcolm," continued the old lady, putting down <a name=
"Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>her book and turning with quickened
interest toward my other self, "who, suppose you, is the man with
whom Dorothy has become so strangely entangled?"</p>
<p>"I cannot tell for the life of me," answered Malcolm No. 2.
"Surely a modest girl would not act as she does."</p>
<p>"Surely a modest girl would," replied Aunt Dorothy, testily.
"Malcolm, you know nothing of women."</p>
<p>"Spoken with truth," thought I.</p>
<p>The old lady continued: "Modesty and love have nothing whatever
to do with each other. When love comes in at the door, modesty
flies out at the window. I do pity my niece with all my heart, and
in good truth I wish I could help her, though of course I would not
have her know my feeling. I feign severity toward her, but I do not
hesitate to tell you that I am greatly interested in her romance.
She surely is deeply in love."</p>
<p>"That is a true word, Aunt Dorothy," said the lovelorn young
woman. "I am sure she is fathoms deep in love."</p>
<p>"Nothing," said Lady Crawford, "but a great passion would have
impelled her to act as she did. Why, even Mary of Burgundy, with
all her modesty, won the husband she wanted, ay, and had him at the
cost of half her rich domain."</p>
<p>"I wonder if Dorothy will ever have the man she wants?" said
Malcolm, sighing in a manner entirely new to him.</p>
<p>"No," answered the old lady, "I fear there is no hope for
Dorothy. I wonder who he is? Her father intends that she shall soon
marry Lord Stanley. Sir George told me as much this morning when he
started for Derby-town to arrange for the signing of the marriage
contract within a day or two. He had a talk yesterday with Dorothy.
She, I believe, has surrendered to the inevitable, and again there
is good feeling between her and my brother."</p>
<p>Dorothy tossed her head expressively.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>It is a good match,"
continued Lady Crawford, "a good match, Malcolm. I pity Dorothy;
but it is my duty to guard her, and I shall do it faithfully."</p>
<p>"My dear Lady Crawford," said my hat and cloak, "your words and
feelings do great credit to your heart. But have you ever thought
that your niece is a very wilful girl, and that she is full of
disturbing expedients? Now I am willing to wager my beard that she
will, sooner than you suspect, see her lover. And I am also willing
to lay a wager that she will marry the man of her choice despite
all the watchfulness of her father and yourself. Keep close guard
over her, my lady, or she will escape."</p>
<p>Lady Crawford laughed. "She shall not escape. Have no fear of
that, Malcolm. The key to the door is always safely locked in my
reticule. No girl can outwit me. I am too old to be caught unawares
by a mere child like Dorothy. It makes me laugh,
Malcolm&mdash;although I am sore at heart for Dorothy's
sake&mdash;it makes me laugh, with a touch of tears, when I think
of poor simple Dorothy's many little artifices to gain possession
of this key. They are amusing and pathetic. Poor child! But I am
too old to be duped by a girl, Malcolm, I am too old. She has no
chance to escape."</p>
<p>I said to myself: "No one has ever become too old to be duped by
a girl who is in love. Her wits grow keen as the otter's fur grows
thick for the winter's need. I do not know your niece's plan; but
if I mistake not, Aunt Dorothy, you will in one respect, at least,
soon be rejuvenated."</p>
<p>"I am sure Lady Crawford is right in what she says," spoke my
other self, "and Sir George is fortunate in having for his daughter
a guardian who cannot be hoodwinked and who is true to a
distasteful trust. I would the trouble were over and that Dorothy
were well married."</p>
<p>"So wish I, Malcolm, with all my heart," replied Aunt
Dorothy.</p>
<p><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>After a brief pause in the
conversation Malcolm No. 2 said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I must now take my leave. Will you kindly unlock the door and
permit me to say good night?"</p>
<p>"If you must go," answered my lady, glad enough to be left alone
with her beloved Sir Philip. Then she unlocked the door.</p>
<p>"Keep good watch, my dear aunt," said Malcolm. "I greatly fear
that Dorothy&mdash;" but the door closed on the remainder of the
sentence and on Dorothy Vernon.</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" ejaculated the old lady somewhat impatiently. "Why
should he fear for Dorothy? I hope I shall not again be disturbed."
And soon she was deep in the pages of her book.</p>

<h2>A TRYST AT BOWLING GREEN GATE</h2>
<p>I was at a loss what course to pursue, and I remained for a
moment in puzzling thought. I went back to Madge, and after closing
the door, told her of all I had seen. She could not advise me, and
of course she was deeply troubled and concerned. After
deliberating, I determined to speak to Aunt Dorothy that she might
know what had happened. So I opened the door and walked into Lady
Crawford's presence. After viewing my lady's back for a short time,
I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I cannot find my hat, cloak, and sword. I left them in
Dorothy's bedroom. Has any one been here since I entered?"</p>
<p>The old lady turned quickly upon me, "Since you entered?" she
cried in wonderment and consternation. "Since you left, you mean.
Did you not leave this room a few minutes ago? What means this? How
found you entrance without the key?"</p>
<p>"I did not leave this room, Aunt Dorothy; you see I am here," I
responded.</p>
<p>"Who did leave? Your wraith? Some one&mdash;Dorothy!" screamed
the old lady in terror. "That girl!!&mdash;Holy Virgin! where is
she?"</p>
<p>Lady Crawford hastened to Dorothy's room and returned to me in
great agitation.</p>
<p>"Were you in the plot?" she demanded angrily.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>No more than were you,
Lady Crawford," I replied, telling the exact truth. If I were
accessory to Dorothy's crime, it was only as a witness and Aunt
Dorothy had seen as much as I.</p>
<p>I continued: "Dorothy left Lady Madge and me at the window,
saying she wished to make a change in her garments. I was watching
the sunset and talking with Lady Madge."</p>
<p>Lady Crawford, being full of concern about the main
event,&mdash;Dorothy's escape,&mdash;was easily satisfied that I
was not accessory before the fact.</p>
<p>"What shall I do, Malcolm? What shall I do? Help me, quickly. My
brother will return in the morning&mdash;perhaps he will return
to-night&mdash;and he will not believe that I have not
intentionally permitted Dorothy to leave the Hall. I have of late
said so much to him on behalf of the girl that he suspects me
already of being in sympathy with her. He will not believe me when
I tell him that I have been duped. The ungrateful, selfish girl!
How could she so unkindly return my affection!"</p>
<p>The old lady began to weep.</p>
<p>I did not believe that Dorothy intended to leave Haddon Hall
permanently. I felt confident she had gone out only to meet John,
and was sure she would soon return. On the strength of that opinion
I said: "If you fear that Sir George will not believe you&mdash;he
certainly will blame you&mdash;would it not be better to admit
Dorothy quietly when she returns and say nothing to any one
concerning the escapade? I will remain here in these rooms, and
when she returns I will depart, and the guards will never suspect
that Dorothy has left the Hall."</p>
<p>"If she will but return," wailed Aunt Dorothy, "I shall be only
too glad to admit her and to keep silent."</p>
<p>"I am sure she will," I answered. "Leave orders with the guard
at Sir George's door to admit me at any time <a name="Page_183" id=
"Page_183"></a>during the night, and Dorothy will come in without
being recognized. Her disguise must be very complete if she could
deceive you."</p>
<p>"Indeed, her disguise is complete," replied the tearful old
lady.</p>
<p>Dorothy's disguise was so complete and her resemblance to me had
been so well contrived that she met with no opposition from the
guards in the retainer's room nor from the porter. She walked out
upon the terrace where she strolled for a short time. Then she
climbed over the wall at the stile back of the terrace and took her
way up Bowling Green Hill toward the gate. She sauntered leisurely
until she was out of sight of the Hall. Then gathering up her cloak
and sword she sped along the steep path to the hill crest and
thence to the gate.</p>
<p>Soon after the first day of her imprisonment she had sent a
letter to John by the hand of Jennie Faxton, acquainting him with
the details of all that had happened. In her letter, among much
else, she said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My true love, I beg you to haunt with your presence Bowling
Green Gate each day at the hour of sunset. I cannot tell you when I
shall be there to meet you, or surely I would do so now. But be
there I will. Let no doubt of that disturb your mind. It does not
lie in the power of man to keep me from you. That is, it lies in
the power of but one man, you, my love and my lord, and I fear not
that you will use your power to that end. So it is that I beg you
to wait for me at sunset hour each day near by Bowling Green Gate.
You may be caused to wait for me a long weary time; but one day,
sooner or later, I shall go to you, and then&mdash;ah, then, if it
be in my power to reward your patience, you shall have no cause for
complaint."</p>
<p>When Dorothy reached the gate she found it securely locked. She
peered eagerly through the bars, hoping to <a name="Page_184" id=
"Page_184"></a>see John. She tried to shake the heavy iron
structure to assure herself that it could not be opened.</p>
<p>"Ah, well," she sighed, "I suppose the reason love laughs at
locksmiths is because he&mdash;or she&mdash;can climb."</p>
<p>Then she climbed the gate and sprang to the ground on the
Devonshire side of the wall.</p>
<p>"What will John think when he sees me in this attire?" she said
half aloud. "Malcolm's cloak serves but poorly to cover me, and I
shall instead be covered with shame and confusion when John comes.
I fear he will think I have disgraced myself." Then, with a sigh,
"But necessity knows no raiment."</p>
<p>She strode about near the gate for a few minutes, wishing that
she were indeed a man, save for one fact: if she were not a woman,
John would not love her, and, above all, she could not love John.
The fact that she could and did love John appealed to Dorothy as
the highest, sweetest privilege that Heaven or earth could offer to
a human being.</p>
<p>The sun had sunk in the west, and his faint parting glory was
but dimly to be seen upon a few small clouds that floated above
Overhaddon Hill. The moon was past its half; and the stars, still
yellow and pale from the lingering glare of day, waited eagerly to
give their twinkling help in lighting the night. The forest near
the gate was dense, and withal the fading light of the sun and the
dawning beams of the moon and stars, deep shadow enveloped Dorothy
and all the scene about her. The girl was disappointed when she did
not see Manners, but she was not vexed. There was but one person in
all the world toward whom she held a patient, humble
attitude&mdash;John. If he, in his greatness, goodness, and
condescension, deigned to come and meet so poor a person as Dorothy
Vernon, she would be thankful and happy; if he did not come, she
would be sorrowful. His will was her will, and she would <a name=
"Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>come again and again until she should
find him waiting for her, and he should stoop to lift her into
heaven.</p>
<p>If there is a place in all the earth where red warm blood counts
for its full value, it is in a pure woman's veins. Through
self-fear it brings to her a proud reserve toward all mankind till
the right one comes. Toward him it brings an eager humbleness that
is the essence and the life of Heaven and of love. Poets may praise
snowy women as they will, but the compelling woman is she of the
warm blood. The snowy woman is the lifeless seed, the rainless
cloud, the unmagnetic lodestone, the drossful iron. The great laws
of nature affect her but passively. If there is aught in the saying
of the ancients, "The best only in nature can survive," the day of
her extermination will come. Fire is as chaste as snow, and
infinitely more comforting.</p>
<p>Dorothy's patience was not to be tried for long. Five minutes
after she had climbed the gate she beheld John riding toward her
from the direction of Rowsley, and her heart beat with thrill upon
thrill of joy. She felt that the crowning moment of her life was at
hand. By the help of a subtle sense&mdash;familiar spirit to her
love perhaps&mdash;she knew that John would ask her to go with him
and to be his wife, despite all the Rutlands and Vernons dead,
living, or to be born. The thought of refusing him never entered
her mind. Queen Nature was on the throne in the fulness of power,
and Dorothy, in perfect attune with her great sovereign, was
fulfilling her destiny in accordance with the laws to which her
drossless being was entirely amenable.</p>
<p>Many times had the fear come to her that Sir John Manners, who
was heir to the great earldom of Rutland,&mdash;he who was so
great, so good, and so beautiful,&mdash;might feel that his duty to
his house past, present, and future, and the obligations of his
position among the grand nobles <a name="Page_186" id=
"Page_186"></a>of the realm, should deter him from a marriage
against which so many good reasons could be urged. But this evening
her familiar spirit whispered to her that she need not fear, and
her heart was filled with joy and certainty. John dismounted and
tethered his horse at a short distance from the gate. He approached
Dorothy, but halted when he beheld a man instead of the girl whom
he longed to meet. His hesitancy surprised Dorothy, who, in her
eagerness, had forgotten her male attire. She soon saw, however,
that he did not recognize her, and she determined, in a spirit of
mischief, to maintain her incognito till he should penetrate her
disguise.</p>
<p>She turned her back on John and sauntered leisurely about,
whistling softly. She pretended to be unconscious of his presence,
and John, who felt that the field was his by the divine right of
love, walked to the gate and looked through the bars toward Bowling
Green. He stood at the gate for a short time with indifference in
his manner and irritation in his heart. He, too, tried to hum a
tune, but failed. Then he tried to whistle, but his musical efforts
were abortive. There was no music in him. A moment before his heart
had been full of harmony; but when he found a man instead of his
sweetheart, the harmony quickly turned to rasping discord.</p>
<p>John was not a patient man, and his impatience was apt to take
the form of words and actions. A little aimless stalking about at
the gate was more than enough for him, so he stepped toward the
intruder and lifted his hat.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, "I thought when first I saw you
that you were Sir Malcolm Vernon. I fancied you bore resemblance to
him. I see that I was in error."</p>
<p>"Yes, in error," answered my beard.</p>
<p>Again the two gentlemen walked around each other with great
amusement on the part of one, and with ever increasing vexation on
the part of the other.</p>
<p><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>Soon John said, "May I ask
whom have I the honor to address?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, you may ask," was the response.</p>
<p>A silence ensued during which Dorothy again turned her back on
John and walked a few paces away from him. John's patience was
rapidly oozing, and when the unknown intruder again turned in his
direction, John said with all the gentleness then at his
command:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, sir, I do ask."</p>
<p>"Your curiosity is flattering," said the girl.</p>
<p>"Pardon me, sir," returned John. "My curiosity is not intended
to be flattering. I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I hope it is not intended to be insulting, sir?" asked my hat
and cloak.</p>
<p>"That, sir, all depends upon yourself," retorted John, warmly.
Then after an instant of thought, he continued in tones of
conciliation:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have an engagement of a private nature at this place. In
short, I hope to meet a&mdash;a friend here within a few minutes
and I feel sure that under the circumstances so gallant a gentleman
as yourself will act with due consideration for the feelings of
another. I hope and believe that you will do as you would be done
by."</p>
<p>"Certainly, certainly," responded the gallant. "I find no fault
at all with your presence. Please take no account whatever of me. I
assure you I shall not be in the least disturbed."</p>
<p>John was somewhat disconcerted.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you will not be disturbed," replied John, struggling to
keep down his temper, "but I fear you do not understand me. I hope
to meet a&mdash;a lady and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I hope also to meet a&mdash;a friend," the fellow said; "but I
assure you we shall in no way conflict."</p>
<p>"May I ask," queried John, "if you expect to meet a gentleman or
a lady?"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>Certainly you may ask,"
was the girl's irritating reply.</p>
<p>"Well, well, sir, I do ask," said John. "Furthermore, I demand
to know whom you expect to meet at this place."</p>
<p>"That, of course, sir, is no business of yours."</p>
<p>"But I shall make it my affair. I expect to meet a lady here, my
sweetheart." The girl's heart jumped with joy. "And if you have any
of the feelings of a gentleman, you must know that your presence
will be intolerable to me."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it will be, my dear sir, but I have as good a right
here as you or any other. If you must know all about my affairs, I
tell you I, too, hope to meet my sweetheart at this place. In fact,
I know I shall meet my sweetheart, and, my good fellow, I beg to
inform you that a stranger's presence would be very annoying to
me."</p>
<p>John was at his wit's end. He must quickly do or say something
to persuade this stubborn fellow to leave. If Dorothy should come
and see two persons at the gate she, of course, would return to the
Hall. Jennie Faxton, who knew that the garments were finished, had
told Sir John that he might reasonably expect to see Dorothy at the
gate on that evening, for Sir George had gone to Derby-town,
presumably to remain over night.</p>
<p>In sheer desperation John said, "I was here first, and I claim
the ground."</p>
<p>"That is not true," replied the other. "I have been waiting here
for you&mdash;I mean for the person I am to meet&mdash;" Dorothy
thought she had betrayed herself, and that John would surely
recognize her. "I had been waiting full five minutes before you
arrived."</p>
<p>John's blindness in failing to recognize Dorothy is past my
understanding. He explained it to me afterward by saying that his
eagerness to see Dorothy, and his fear, nay almost certainty, that
she could not come, coupled with the hope which Jennie Faxton had
given him, had so completely <a name="Page_189" id=
"Page_189"></a>occupied his mind that other subjects received but
slight consideration.</p>
<p>"But I&mdash;I have been here before this night to
meet&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And I have been here to meet&mdash;quite as often as you, I
hope," retorted Dorothy.</p>
<p>They say that love blinds a man. It must also have deafened
John, since he did not recognize his sweetheart's voice.</p>
<p>"It may be true that you have been here before this evening,"
retorted John, angrily; "but you shall not remain here now. If you
wish to save yourself trouble, leave at once. If you stalk about in
the forest, I will run you through and leave you for the crows to
pick."</p>
<p>"I have no intention of leaving, and if I were to do so you
would regret it; by my beard, you would regret it," answered the
girl, pleased to see John in his overbearing, commanding mood. His
stupidity was past comprehension.</p>
<p>"Defend yourself," said John, drawing his sword.</p>
<p>"Now he will surely know the truth," thought Dorothy, but she
said: "I am much younger than you, and am not so large and strong.
I am unskilled in the use of a sword, and therefore am I no match
for Sir John Manners than whom, I have heard, there is no better
swordsman, stronger arm, nor braver heart in England."</p>
<p>"You flatter me, my friend," returned John, forced into a good
humor against his will; "but you must leave. He who cannot defend
himself must yield; it is the law of nature and of men."</p>
<p>John advanced toward Dorothy, who retreated stepping backward,
holding her arm over her face.</p>
<p>"I am ready to yield if you wish. In fact, I am eager to
yield&mdash;more eager than you can know," she cried.</p>
<p>"It is well," answered John, putting his sword in sheath.</p>
<p>"But," continued Dorothy, "I will not go away."</p>
<p>"Then you must fight," said John.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>I tell you again I am
willing, nay, eager to yield to you, but I also tell you I cannot
fight in the way you would have me. In other ways perhaps I can
fight quite as well as anybody. But really, I am ashamed to draw my
sword, since to do so would show you how poorly I am equipped to
defend myself under your great laws of nature and of man. Again, I
wish to assure you that I am more than eager to yield; but I cannot
fight you, and I will not go away."</p>
<p>The wonder never ceases that John did not recognize her. She
took no pains to hide her identity, and after a few moments of
concealment she was anxious that John should discover her under my
garments.</p>
<p>"I would know his voice," she thought, "did he wear all the
petticoats in Derbyshire."</p>
<p>"What shall I do with you?" cried John, amused and irritated. "I
cannot strike you."</p>
<p>"No, of course you would not murder me in cold blood," answered
Dorothy, laughing heartily. She was sure her laughter would open
John's eyes.</p>
<p>"I cannot carry you away," said John.</p>
<p>"I would come back again, if you did," answered the
irrepressible fellow.</p>
<p>"I suppose you would," returned John, sullenly. "In the devil's
name, tell me what you will do. Can I not beg you to go?"</p>
<p>"Now, Sir John, you have touched me. I make you this offer: you
expect Mistress Vernon to come from the Hall&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What do you know about Mistress Vernon?" cried John. "By God, I
will&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Now don't grow angry, Sir John, and please don't swear in my
presence. You expect her, I say, to come from the Hall. What I
propose is this: you shall stand by the gate and watch for
Doll&mdash;oh, I mean Mistress<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>
Vernon&mdash;and I will stand here behind the wall where she cannot
see me. When she comes in sight&mdash;though in truth I don't think
she will come, and I believe were she under your very nose you
would not see her&mdash;you shall tell me and I will leave at once;
that is, if you wish me to leave. After you see Dorothy Vernon if
you still wish me to go, I pledge my faith no power can keep me.
Now is not that fair? I like you very much, and I want to remain
here, if you will permit me, and talk to you for a little
time&mdash;till you see Doll Vernon."</p>
<p>"Doll Vernon, fellow? How dare you so speak of her?" demanded
John, hotly.</p>
<p>"Your pardon and her pardon, I beg; Mistress Vernon, soon to be
Countess of Derbyshire. By the way, I wager you a gold pound
sterling that by the time you see Doll Vernon&mdash;Mistress
Vernon, I pray your pardon&mdash;you will have grown so fond of me
that you will not permit me to leave you." She thought after that
speech he could not help but know her; but John's skull was like an
oaken board that night. Nothing could penetrate it. He began to
fancy that his companion was a simple witless person who had
escaped from his keepers.</p>
<p>"Will you take the wager?" asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" was the only reply John deigned to give to so
foolish a proposition.</p>
<p>"Then will you agree that I shall remain at the gate till
Doll&mdash;Mistress Vernon comes?"</p>
<p>"I suppose I shall have to make the best terms possible with
you," he returned. "You are an amusing fellow and as perverse as a
woman."</p>
<p>"I knew you would soon learn to like me," she responded. "The
first step toward a man's affection is to amuse him. That old saw
which says the road to a man's heart is through his stomach, is a
sad mistake. Amusement is the highway to a man's affections."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>It is better that one
laugh with us than at us. There is a vast difference in the two
methods," answered John, contemptuously.</p>
<p>"You dare to laugh at me," cried Dorothy, grasping the hilt of
her sword, and pretending to be angry. John waved her off with his
hand, and laughingly said, "Little you know concerning the way to a
man's heart, and no doubt less of the way to a woman's."</p>
<p>"I, perhaps, know more about it than you would believe,"
returned Malcolm No. 2.</p>
<p>"If you know aught of the latter subject, it is more than I
would suppose," said John. "It is absurd to say that a woman can
love a man who is unable to defend himself."</p>
<p>"A vain man thinks that women care only for men of his own
pattern," retorted Dorothy. "Women love a strong arm, it is true,
but they also love a strong heart, and you see I am not at all
afraid of you, even though you have twice my strength. There are as
many sorts of bravery, Sir John, as&mdash;as there are hairs in my
beard."</p>
<p>"That is not many," interrupted John.</p>
<p>"And," continued the girl, "I believe, John,&mdash;Sir
John,&mdash;you possess all the kinds of bravery that are
good."</p>
<p>"You flatter me," said John.</p>
<p>"Yes," returned Dorothy, "that was my intent."</p>
<p>After that unflattering remark there came a pause. Then the girl
continued somewhat hesitatingly: "Doubtless many women, Sir John,
have seen your virtues more clearly than even I see them. Women
have a keener perception of masculine virtues than&mdash;than we
have."</p>
<p>Dorothy paused, and her heart beat with a quickened throb while
she awaited his reply. A new field of discovery was opening up to
her and a new use for her disguise.</p>
<p>John made no reply, but the persistent girl pursued her new line
of attack.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>Surely Sir John Manners
has had many sweethearts," said Dorothy, in flattering tones. There
were rocks and shoals ahead for John's love barge. "Many, many, I
am sure," the girl persisted.</p>
<p>"Ah, a few, a few, I admit," John like a fool replied. Dorothy
was accumulating disagreeable information rapidly.</p>
<p>"While you were at London court," said she, "the fine ladies
must have sought you in great numbers&mdash;I am sure they
did."</p>
<p>"Perhaps, oh, perhaps," returned John. "One cannot always
remember such affairs." His craft was headed for the rocks. Had he
observed Dorothy's face, he would have seen the storm
a-brewing.</p>
<p>"To how many women, Sir John, have you lost your heart, and at
various times how many have lost their hearts to you?" asked the
persistent girl.&mdash;"What a senseless question," returned John.
"A dozen times or more; perhaps a score or two score times. I
cannot tell the exact number. I did not keep an account."</p>
<p>Dorothy did not know whether she wanted to weep or be angry.
Pique and a flash of temper, however, saved her from tears, and she
said, "You are so brave and handsome that you must have found it a
very easy task&mdash;much easier than it would be for me&mdash;to
convince those confiding ones of your affection?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied John, plunging full sail upon the breakers, "I
admit that usually they have been quite easy to convince. I am
naturally bold, and I suppose that perhaps&mdash;that is, I may
possibly have a persuasive trick about me."</p>
<p>Shades of good men who have blundered into ruin over the path of
petty vanity, save this man! But no, Dorothy must drink the bitter
cup of knowledge to the dregs.</p>
<p>"And you have been false to all of these women? she said.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>Ah, well, you
know&mdash;the devil take it! A man can't be true to a score of
women," replied John.</p>
<p>"I am sure none of them wished you to be true," the girl
answered, restraining her tears with great difficulty.</p>
<p>At that point in the conversation John began to suspect from the
manner and shapeliness of his companion that a woman had disguised
herself in man's attire. Yet it did not once occur to him that
Dorothy's fair form was concealed within the disguise. He attempted
to lift my soft beaver hat, the broad rim of which hid Dorothy's
face, but to that she made a decided objection, and John continued:
"By my soul I believe you are a woman. Your walk"&mdash;Dorothy
thought she had been swaggering like a veritable
swash-buckler&mdash;"your voice, the curves of your form, all
betray you." Dorothy gathered the cloak closely about her.</p>
<p>"I would know more of you," said John, and he stepped toward the
now interesting stranger. But she drew away from him, and told him
to keep hands off.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am right. You are a woman," said John.</p>
<p>Dorothy had maintained the disguise longer than she wished, and
was willing that John should discover her identity. At first it had
been rare sport to dupe him; but the latter part of her
conversation had given her no pleasure. She was angry, jealous, and
hurt by what she had learned.</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered, "I admit that I am a&mdash;a woman. Now I
must go."</p>
<p>"Stay but one moment," pleaded John, whose curiosity and
gallantry were aroused. "I will watch for Mistress Vernon, and when
she appears, then you may go."</p>
<p>"I told you that you would want me to remain," said the girl
with a sigh. She was almost ready to weep. Then she thought: "I
little dreamed I was coming here for this. I will carry the
disguise a little farther, and will, perhaps, learn enough
to&mdash;to break my heart."</p>
<p><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>She was soon to learn all
she wanted to know and a great deal more.</p>
<p>"Come sit by me on this stone," said John, coaxingly. The girl
complied, and drew the cloak over her knees.</p>
<p>"Tell me why you are here," he asked.</p>
<p>"To meet a gentleman," she replied, with low-bent face.</p>
<p>"Tell me your name," John asked, as he drew my glove from her
passive hand. John held the hand in his, and after examining it in
the dim light saw that it was a great deal more than good to look
upon. Then he lifted it to his lips and said:</p>
<p>"Since our sweethearts have disappointed us, may we not console
ourselves with each other?" He placed his arm around the girl's
waist and drew her yielding form toward him. Dorothy, unobserved by
John, removed the false beard and moustachio, and when John put his
arm about her waist and leaned forward to kiss the fair
accommodating neighbor she could restrain her tears no longer and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"That would be no consolation for me, John; that would be no
consolation for me. How can you? How can you?"</p>
<p>She rose to her feet and covered her face with her hands in a
paroxysm of weeping. John, too, sprang to his feet, you may be
sure. "Dorothy! God help me! I am the king of fools. Curse this
hour in which I have thrown away my heaven. You must hate and
despise me, fool, fool that I am."</p>
<p>John knew that it were worse than useless for him to attempt an
explanation. The first thought that flashed through his mind was,
to tell the girl that he had only pretended not to know her. He
thought he would try to make her believe that he had been turning
her trick upon herself; but he was wise in his day and generation,
and did not seek refuge in that falsehood.</p>
<p><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>The girl would never have
forgiven him for that.</p>
<p>"The only amends I can make," he said, in very dolefulness, "is
that I may never let you see my face again."</p>
<p>"That will not help matters," sobbed Dorothy.</p>
<p>"I know it will not," returned John. "Nothing can help me. I can
remain here no longer. I must leave you. I cannot even ask you to
say farewell. Mistress Vernon, you do not despise me half so
bitterly as I despise myself."</p>
<p>Dorothy was one of those rare natures to whom love comes but
once. It had come to her and had engulfed her whole being. To part
with it would be like parting with life itself. It was her tyrant,
her master. It was her ego. She could no more throw it off than she
could expel herself from her own existence. All this she knew full
well, for she had analyzed her conditions, and her reason had
joined with all her other faculties in giving her a clear concept
of the truth. She knew she belonged to John Manners for life and
for eternity. She also knew that the chance of seeing him soon
again was very slight, and to part from him now in aught but
kindness would almost kill her.</p>
<p>Before John had recognized Dorothy he certainly had acted like a
fool, but with the shock of recognition came wisdom. All the
learning of the ancients and all the cunning of the prince of
darkness could not have taught him a wiser word with which to make
his peace, "I may never let you see my face again." That was more
to be feared by Dorothy than even John's inconstancy.</p>
<p>Her heart was full of trouble. "I do not know what I wish," she
said simply. "Give me a little time to think."</p>
<p>John's heart leaped with joy, but he remained silent.</p>
<p>Dorothy continued: "Oh, that I had remained at home. I would to
God I had never seen Derby-town nor you."</p>
<p>John in the fulness of his wisdom did not interrupt her.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>To think that I have thus
made a fool of myself about a man who has given his heart to a
score of women."</p>
<p>"This is torture," moaned John, in real pain.</p>
<p>"But," continued Dorothy, "I could not remain away from this
place when I had the opportunity to come to you. I felt that I must
come. I felt that I should die if I did not. And you are so false.
I wish I were dead. A moment ago, had I been another woman, you
would have kissed her. You thought I was another woman."</p>
<p>John's wisdom stood by him nobly. He knew he could neither
explain successfully nor beg forgiveness. He simply said: "I cannot
remain and look you in the face. If I dare make any request, it is
that despite all you have heard from my lips you will still believe
that I love you, and that in all my life I have never loved any one
so dearly. There is no other woman for me."</p>
<p>"You doubtless spoke the same false words to the other two score
women," said Dorothy. Tears and sobs were playing sad havoc with
her powers of speech.</p>
<p>"Farewell, Mistress Vernon," replied John. "I should be
shameless if I dared ask you to believe any word I can utter.
Forget, if possible, that I ever existed; forget me that you may
not despise me. I am unworthy to dwell even in the smallest of your
thoughts. I am altogether base and contemptible."</p>
<p>"N-o-o," sighed Dorothy, poutingly, while she bent low her head
and toyed with the gold lace of my cloak.</p>
<p>"Farewell," said John. He took a step or two backward from
her.</p>
<p>"You are over-eager to leave, it seems to me," said the girl in
an injured tone. "I wonder that you came at all." John's heart was
singing hosanna. He, however, maintained his voice at a mournful
pitch and said: "I must go. I can no longer endure to remain."
While he spoke he moved toward his horse, and his head was bowed
with <a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>real shame as he thought
of the pitiable fool he had made of himself. Dorothy saw him going
from her, and she called to him softly and reluctantly, "John."</p>
<p>He did not hear her, or perhaps he thought best to pretend that
he did not hear, and as he moved from her the girl became
desperate. Modesty, resentment, insulted womanhood and injured
pride were all swept away by the stream of her mighty love, and she
cried again, this time without hesitancy or reluctance, "John,
John." She started to run toward him, but my cloak was in her way,
and the sword tripped her feet. In her fear lest John might leave
her, she unclasped the sword-belt from her waist and snatched the
cloak from her shoulders. Freed from these hindrances, she ran
toward John.</p>
<p>"John, do not leave me. Do not leave me." As she spoke, she
reached an open space among the trees and John turned toward her.
Her hat had fallen off, and the red golden threads of her hair,
freed from their fastenings, streamed behind her. Never before had
a vision of such exquisite loveliness sped through the moonbeams.
So entrancing was her beauty to John that he stood motionless in
admiration. He did not go to meet her as he should have done, and
perhaps as he would have done had his senses not been wrapped in
benumbing wonderment. His eyes were unable to interpret to his
brain all her marvellous beauty, and his other senses abandoning
their proper functions had hastened to the assistance of his sight
He saw, he heard, he felt her loveliness. Thus occupied he did not
move, so Dorothy ran to him and fell upon his breast.</p>
<p>"You did not come to meet me," she sobbed. "You made me come all
the way, to forgive you. Cruel, cruel!"</p>
<p>John held the girl in his arms, but he did not dare to kiss her,
and his self-denial soon brought its reward. He had not expected
that she would come a beggar to him.<a name="Page_199" id=
"Page_199"></a> The most he had dared to hope was that she would
listen to his prayer for forgiveness. With all his worldly wisdom
John had not learned the fact that inconstancy does not destroy
love in the one who suffers by reason of it; nor did he know of the
exquisite pain-touched happiness which comes to a gentle,
passionate heart such as Dorothy's from the mere act of
forgiving.</p>
<p>"Is it possible you can forgive me for the miserable lies I have
uttered?" asked John, almost unconscious of the words he was
speaking. "Is it possible you can forgive me for uttering those
lies, Dorothy?" he repeated.</p>
<p>She laid her head upon his breast, and softly passing her hand
over the lace of his doublet, whispered:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If I could believe they were lies, I could easily forgive you,"
she answered between low sobs and soft sighs. Though she was a
woman, the sweet essence of childhood was in her heart.</p>
<p>"But you cannot believe me, even when I tell you that I spoke
not the truth," answered John, with growing faith in his system of
passive repentance. Again came the sighs, and a few struggling,
childish sobs.</p>
<p>"It is easy for us to believe that which we long to believe,"
she said. Then she turned her face upward to him, and John's reward
was altogether disproportioned to the self-denial he had exercised
a few minutes before. She rewarded him far beyond his deserts; and
after a pause she said mischievously:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You told me that you were a bold man with women, and I know
that at least that part of what you said was untrue, for you are a
bashful man, John, you are downright bashful. It is I who have been
bold. You were too timid to woo me, and I so longed for you that
I&mdash;I&mdash;was not timid."</p>
<p>"For God's sake, Dorothy, I beg you to have pity and to make no
jest of me. Your kindness almost kills me, and your
ridicule&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>There, there, John,"
whispered the girl, "I will never again make a jest of you if it
gives you pain. Tell me, John, tell me truly, was it all
false&mdash;that which you told me about the other women?"</p>
<p>There had been more truth in John's bragging than he cared to
confess. He feared and loathed a lie; so he said evasively, but
with perfect truth:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You must know, my goddess. If you do not know without the
telling that I love you with all my being; if you do not know that
there is for me and ever will be no woman but you in all the world;
if you do not know that you have stolen my soul and that I live
only in your presence, all that I can say will avail nothing toward
convincing you. I am almost crazed with love for you, and with pain
and torture. For the love of God let me leave you that I may hide
my face."</p>
<p>"Never," cried the girl, clasping her hands about his neck and
pressing her lips gently upon his. "Never. There, that will soothe
you, won't it, John?"</p>
<p>It did soothe him, and in the next moment, John, almost frenzied
with joy, hurt the girl by the violence of his embraces; but she,
woman-like, found her heaven in the pain.</p>
<p>They went back to the stone bench beside the gate, and after a
little time Dorothy said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"But tell me, John, would you have kissed the other woman? Would
you really have done it?"</p>
<p>John's honesty certainly was good policy in that instance. The
adroit girl had set a trap for him.</p>
<p>"I suppose I would," answered John, with a groan.</p>
<p>"It hurts me to hear the fact," said Dorothy, sighing; "but it
pleases me to hear the truth. I know all else you tell me is true.
I was trying you when I asked the question, for I certainly knew
what you intended to do. A woman instinctively knows when a man is
going to&mdash;to&mdash;when anything of that sort is about to
happen."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>How does she know?" asked
John.</p>
<p>Rocks and breakers ahead for Dorothy.</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you," replied the girl, na&iuml;vely, "but she
knows."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is the awakened desire in her own heart which
forewarns her," said John, stealthily seeking from Dorothy a truth
that would pain him should he learn it.</p>
<p>"I suppose that is partly the source of her knowledge," replied
the knowing one, with a great show of innocence in her manner. John
was in no position to ask impertinent questions, nor had he any
right to grow angry at unpleasant discoveries; but he did both,
although for a time he suppressed the latter.</p>
<p>"You believe she is sure to know, do you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Usually," she replied. "Of course there are times
when&mdash;when it happens so suddenly that&mdash;"</p>
<p>John angrily sprang to his feet, took a few hurried steps in
front of Dorothy, who remained demurely seated with her eyes cast
down, and then again he took his place beside her on the stone
bench. He was trembling with anger and jealousy. The devil was in
the girl that night for mischief.</p>
<p>"I suppose you speak from the fulness of your experience,"
demanded John, in tones that would have been insulting had they not
been pleasing to the girl. She had seen the drift of John's
questions at an early stage of the conversation, and his easily
aroused jealousy was good proof to her of his affection. After all,
she was in no danger from rocks and breakers. She well knew the
currents, eddies, rocks, and shoals of the sea she was navigating,
although she had never before sailed it. Her fore-mothers, all the
way back to Eve, had been making charts of those particular waters
for her especial benefit. Why do we, a slow-moving, cumbersome army
of men, continue to do battle with the foe at whose hands defeat is
always our portion?</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>Experience?" queried
Dorothy, her head turned to one side in a half-contemplative
attitude. "Experience? Of course that is the only way we learn
anything."</p>
<p>John again sprang to his feet, and again he sat down beside the
girl. He had so recently received forgiveness for his own sins that
he dared not be unforgiving toward Dorothy. He did not speak, and
she remained silent, willing to allow time for the situation to
take its full effect. The wisdom of the serpent is black ignorance
compared with the cunning of a girl in Dorothy's situation. God
gives her wit for the occasion as He gives the cat soft paws, sharp
claws, and nimbleness. She was teaching John a lesson he would
never forget. She was binding him to her with hoops of steel.</p>
<p>"I know that I have not the right to ask," said John,
suppressing his emotions, "but may I know merely as a matter of
trivial information&mdash;may I know the name of&mdash;of the
person&mdash;this fellow with whom you have had so full an
experience? God curse him! Tell me his name." He caught the girl
violently by both arms as if he would shake the truth out of her.
He was unconsciously making full amends for the faults he had
committed earlier in the evening. The girl made no answer. John's
powers of self-restraint, which were not of the strongest order,
were exhausted, and he again sprang to his feet and stood towering
before her in a passion. "Tell me his name," he said hoarsely. "I
demand it. I will not rest till I kill him."</p>
<p>"If you would kill him, I surely will not tell you his name. In
truth, I admit I am very fond of him."</p>
<p>"Speak not another word to me till you tell me his name,"
stormed John. I feel sorry for John when I think of the part he
played in this interview; but every man knows well his
condition.</p>
<p>"I care not," continued John, "in what manner I have <a name=
"Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>offended you, nor does my debt of
gratitude to you for your generosity in forgiving my sins weigh one
scruple against this you have told me. No man, unless he were a
poor clown, would endure it; and I tell you now, with all my love
for you, I will not&mdash;I will not!"</p>
<p>Dorothy was beginning to fear him. She of course did not fear
personal violence; but after all, while he was slower than she, he
was much stronger every way, and when aroused, his strength imposed
itself upon her and she feared to play him any farther.</p>
<p>"Sit beside me, John, and I will tell you his name," said the
girl, looking up to him, and then casting down her eyes. A dimpling
smile was playing about her lips.</p>
<p>"No, I will not sit by you," replied John, angrily. She partly
rose, and taking him by the arm drew him to her side.</p>
<p>"Tell me his name," again demanded John, sitting rigidly by
Dorothy. "Tell me his name."</p>
<p>"Will you kill him?" she asked.</p>
<p>"That I will," he answered. "Of that you may rest assured."</p>
<p>"If you kill him, John, it will break my heart; for to do so,
you must commit suicide. There is no other man but you, John. With
you I had my first, last, and only experience."</p>
<p>John, of course, was speechless. He had received only what he
deserved. I freely admit he played the part of a fool during this
entire interview with Dorothy, and he was more fully convinced of
the fact than either you or I can be. I do not like to have a fool
for the hero of my history; but this being a history and not a
romance, I must tell you of events just as they happened, and of
persons exactly as they were, else my conscience will smite me for
untruthfulness. Dorothy's last assault was too much for John. He
could neither parry nor thrust.</p>
<p><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>Her heart was full of mirth
and gladness.</p>
<p>"None other but you, John," she repeated, leaning forward in
front of him, and looking up into his eyes. A ray of moonlight
stealing its way between the forest boughs fell upon her upturned
face and caused it to glow with a goddess-like radiance.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="v204" id="v204"></a> <img src=
"images/v204.jpg" alt="" title="" /></div>
<p>"None but you, John. There never has been and there never shall
be another."</p>
<p>When John's consciousness returned he said, "Dorothy, can you
love such a fool as I?"</p>
<p>"That I can and that I do with all my heart," she returned.</p>
<p>"And can you forgive me for this last fault&mdash;for doubting
you?"</p>
<p>"That is easily done," she answered softly, "because doubt is
the child of love."</p>
<p>"But you do not doubt me?" he replied.</p>
<p>"N-o-o," she answered somewhat haltingly; "but I&mdash;I am a
woman."</p>
<p>"And a woman's heart is the home of faith," said John,
reverentially.</p>
<p>"Y-e-s," she responded, still not quite sure of her ground.
"Sometimes it is the home of too much faith, but faith, like
virtue, is its own reward. Few persons are false to one who gives a
blind, unquestioning faith. Even a poor degree of honor responds to
it in kind."</p>
<p>"Dorothy, I am so unworthy of you that I stand abashed in your
presence," replied John.</p>
<p>"No, you are not unworthy of me. We don't look for unmixed good
in men," said the girl with a mischievous little laugh. Then
seriously: "Those virtues you have are so great and so strong,
John, that my poor little virtues, while they perhaps are more
numerous than yours, are but weak things by comparison. In truth,
there are some faults in men which we women do not&mdash;do not
altogether <a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>dislike. They cause
us&mdash;they make us&mdash;oh, I cannot express exactly what I
mean. They make us more eager perhaps. A too constant man is like
an overstrong sweet: he cloys us. The faults I speak of hurt us;
but we thrive on them. Women enjoy pain now and then. Malcolm was
telling me the other day that the wise people of the East have a
saying: 'Without shadow there can be no light; without death there
can be no life; without suffering there can be no joy.' Surely is
that saying true of women. She who suffers naught enjoys naught.
When a woman becomes passive, John, she is but a clod. Pain gives
us a vent&mdash;a vent for something, I know not what it is; but
this I know, we are happier for it."</p>
<p>"I fear, Dorothy, that I have given you too much 'vent,' as you
call it," said John.</p>
<p>"No, no," she replied. "That was nothing. My great vent is that
I can pour out my love upon you, John, without stint. Now that I
know you are mine, I have some one whom I can deluge with it. Do
you know, John, I believe that when God made me He collected
together the requisite portions of reason, imagination, and
will,&mdash;there was a great plenty of will, John,&mdash;and all
the other ingredients that go to make a human being. But after He
had gotten them all together there was still a great space left to
be filled, and He just threw in an immensity of love with which to
complete me. Therefore, John, am I not in true proportion. There is
too much love in me, and it wells up at times and overflows my
heart. How thankful I should be that I may pour it upon you and
that it will not be wasted. How good you are to give me the sweet
privilege."</p>
<p>"How thankful should I be, Dorothy. I have never known you till
this night. I am unworthy&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not another word of that sort, John," she interrupted, covering
his mouth with her hand.</p>
<p><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>They stood for a long time
talking a deal of celestial nonsense which I shall not give you. I
fear I have already given you too much of what John and Dorothy did
and said in this very sentimental interview. But in no other way
can I so well make you to know the persons of whom I write. I might
have said Dorothy was so and so, and John was such and such. I
might have analyzed them in long, dull pages of minute description;
but it is that which persons do and say that gives us true concept
of their characters; what others say about them is little else than
a mere statement that black is black and white is white. But to my
story again.</p>
<p>Dorothy by her beauty had won John's admiration when first he
beheld her. When he met her afterward, her charms of mind and her
thousand winsome ways moved him deeply. But upon the evening of
which I am now telling you he beheld for the first time her grand
burning soul, and he saw her pure heart filled to overflowing with
its dangerous burden of love, right from the hands of God Himself,
as the girl had said. John was of a coarser fibre than she who had
put him up for her idol; but his sensibilities were keen, and at
their awakening he saw clearly the worth of the priceless treasure
which propitious fate had given him in the love of Dorothy, and he
sat humbly at her feet. Yet she knew it not, but sat humbly at
John's feet the happiest woman in all the world because of her
great good fortune in having a demi-god upon whom she could lavish
the untold wealth of her heart. If you are a woman, pray God that
He may touch your eyes with Dorothy's blessed blindness. There is a
heaven in the dark for you, if you can find it.</p>
<p>I must leave the scene, though I am loath to do so. Seldom do we
catch a glimpse of a human soul, and more seldom still does it show
itself like a gust of God's breath upon the deep of eternity as it
did that night in Dorothy.</p>
<p><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>After a time John said: "I
have your promise to be my wife. Do you still wish to keep it?"</p>
<p>"What an absurd question, John," replied the girl, laughing
softly and contentedly. "Why else am I here? Tell me, think you,
John, should I be here if I were not willing and eager to&mdash;to
keep that promise?"</p>
<p>"Will you go with me notwithstanding your father's hatred of my
house?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, truly that I will, John," she answered; "surely you know I
will go with you."</p>
<p>"Let us go at once. Let us lose not a moment. We have already
delayed too long," cried John in eager ecstasy.</p>
<p>"Not to-night, John; I cannot go to-night," she pleaded. "Think
of my attire," and she drew my cloak more closely about her. "I
cannot go with you this time. My father is angry with me because of
you, although he does not know who you are. Is it not famous to
have a lover in secret of whom nobody knows? Father is angry with
me, and as I told you in my letter, he keeps me a prisoner in my
rooms. Aunt Dorothy stands guard over me. The dear, simple old
soul! She told me, thinking I was Malcolm, that she was too old to
be duped by a girl! Oh, it was too comical!" And she threw back her
head and gave forth a peal of laughter that John was reluctantly
compelled to silence. "I would so delight to tell you of the scene
when I was in Aunt Dorothy's room impersonating Malcolm; but I have
so much else to say of more importance that I know I shall not tell
the half. When you have left me, I shall remember what I most
wished to say but forgot."</p>
<p>"No, John," she continued seriously, "my father has been cruel
to me, and I try to make myself think I do not love him; but I
fail, for I do love him." Tears were welling up in her eyes and
stifling her voice. In a moment <a name="Page_208" id=
"Page_208"></a>she continued: "It would kill him, John, were I to
go with you now. I <i>will</i> go with you soon,&mdash;I give you
my solemn promise to that&mdash;but I cannot go now,&mdash;not now.
I cannot leave him and the others. With all his cruelty to me, I
love him, John, next to you. He will not come to see me nor will he
speak to me. Think of that." The tears that had welled up to her
eyes fell in a piteous stream over her cheeks. "Aunt Dorothy and
Madge," she continued, "are so dear to me that the thought of
leaving them is torture. But I will go with you some day, John,
some day soon, I promise you. They have always been kind and gentle
to me, and I love them and my father and my dear home where I was
born and where my sweet mother died&mdash;and Dolcy&mdash;I love
them all so dearly that I must prepare myself to leave them, John,
even to go with you. The heart strings of my whole life bind me to
them. Forgive me, John, forgive me. You must think of the grief and
pain I shall yet pass through to go to you. It is as I told you: we
women reach heaven only through purgatory. I must forsake all else
I love when I go to you. All, all! All that has been dear to me in
life I must forsake for&mdash;for that which is dearer to me than
life itself. I promise, John, to go with you, but&mdash;but forgive
me. I cannot go to-night."</p>
<p>"Nor can I ask it of you, Dorothy," said John. "The sacrifice
would be all on one side. I should forego nothing, and I should
receive all. You would forego everything, and God help me, you
would receive nothing worth having. I am unworthy&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not that word, John," cried Dorothy, again covering his mouth
with&mdash;well, not with her hand. "I shall give up a great deal,"
she continued, "and I know I shall suffer. I suffer even now when I
think of it, for you must remember that I am rooted to my home and
to the dear ones it shelters; but I will soon make the
exchange,<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a> John; I shall make
it gladly when the time comes, because&mdash;because I feel that I
could not live if I did not make it."</p>
<p>"My father has already consented to our marriage," said John. "I
told him to-day all that had passed between you and me. He, of
course, was greatly pained at first; but when I told him of your
perfections, he said that if you and I were dear to each other, he
would offer no opposition, but would welcome you to his heart."</p>
<p>"Is your father that&mdash;that sort of a man?" asked Dorothy,
half in revery. "I have always heard&mdash;" and she hesitated.</p>
<p>"I know," replied John, "that you have heard much evil of my
father, but&mdash;let us not talk on that theme. You will know him
some day, and you may judge him for yourself. When will you go with
me, Dorothy?"</p>
<p>"Soon, very soon, John," she answered. "You know father intends
that I shall marry Lord Stanley. <i>I</i> intend otherwise. The
more father hurries this marriage with my beautiful cousin the
sooner I shall be&mdash;be your&mdash;that is, you know, the sooner
I shall go with you."</p>
<p>"You will not allow your father to force you to marry Lord
Stanley?" asked John, frightened by the thought.</p>
<p>"Ah," cried the girl, softly, "you know I told you that God had
put into me a great plenty of will. Father calls it wilfulness; but
whichever it is, it stands me in good hand now. You don't know how
much I have of it! You never will know until I am
your&mdash;your&mdash;wife." The last word was spoken in a soft,
hesitating whisper, and her head sought shamefaced refuge on John's
breast. Of course the magic word "wife" on Dorothy's lips aroused
John to action, and&mdash;but a cloud at that moment passed over
the moon and kindly obscured the scene.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>You do not blame me,
John," said Dorothy, "because I cannot go with you to-night? You do
not blame me?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I do not, my goddess," answered John. "You will soon be
mine. I shall await your pleasure and your own time, and when you
choose to come to me&mdash;ah, then&mdash;" And the kindly cloud
came back to the moon.</p>

<h2>THOMAS THE MAN SERVANT</h2>
<p>After a great effort of self-denial John told Dorothy it was
time for her to return to the Hall, and he walked with her down
Bowling Green Hill to the wall back of the terrace garden.</p>
<p>Dorothy stood for a moment on the stile at the old stone wall,
and John, clasping her hand, said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You will perhaps see me sooner than you expect," and then the
cloud considerately floated over the moon again, and John hurried
away up Bowling Green Hill.</p>
<p>Dorothy crossed the terrace garden, going toward the door since
known as "Dorothy's Postern." She had reached the top of the
postern steps when she heard her father's voice, beyond the north
wall of the terrace garden well up toward Bowling Green Hill. John,
she knew, was at that moment climbing the hill. Immediately
following the sound of her father's voice she heard another
voice&mdash;that of her father's retainer, Sir John Guild. Then
came the word "Halt!" quickly followed by the report of a fusil,
and the sharp clinking of swords upon the hillside. She ran back to
the wall, and saw the dimly outlined forms of four men. One of them
was John, who was retreating up the hill. The others were following
him. Sir George and Sir John Guild had unexpectedly returned from
Derby. They had left their horses with the stable boys and were
walking toward the kitchen door when Sir George noticed <a name=
"Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>a man pass from behind the corner of
the terrace garden wall and proceed up Bowling Green Hill. The man
of course was John. Immediately Sir George and Guild, accompanied
by a servant who was with them, started in pursuit of the intruder,
and a moment afterward Dorothy heard her father's voice and the
discharge of the fusil. She climbed to the top of the stile, filled
with an agony of fear. Sir George was fifteen or twenty yards in
advance of his companion, and when John saw that his pursuers were
attacking him singly, he turned and quickly ran back to meet the
warlike King of the Peak. By a few adroit turns with his sword John
disarmed his antagonist, and rushing in upon him easily threw him
to the ground by a wrestler's trick. Guild and the servant by that
time were within six yards of Sir George and John.</p>
<p>"Stop!" cried Manners, "your master is on the ground at my feet.
My sword point is at his heart. Make but one step toward me and Sir
George Vernon will be a dead man."</p>
<p>Guild and the servant halted instantly.</p>
<p>"What are your terms?" cried Guild, speaking with the haste
which he well knew was necessary if he would save his master's
life.</p>
<p>"My terms are easy," answered John. "All I ask is that you allow
me to depart in peace. I am here on no harmful errand, and I demand
that I may depart and that I be not followed nor spied upon by any
one."</p>
<p>"You may depart in peace," said Guild. "No one will follow you;
no one will spy upon you. To this I pledge my knightly word in the
name of Christ my Saviour."</p>
<p>John at once took his way unmolested up the hill and rode home
with his heart full of fear lest his tryst with Dorothy had been
discovered.</p>
<p>Guild and the servant assisted Sir George to rise, and the three
started down the hill toward the stile where Dorothy <a name=
"Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>was standing. She was hidden from
them, however, by the wall. Jennie Faxton, who had been on guard
while John and Dorothy were at the gate, at Dorothy's suggestion
stood on top of the stile where she could easily be seen by Sir
George when he approached.</p>
<p>"When my father comes here and questions you," said Dorothy to
Jennie Faxton, "tell him that the man whom he attacked was your
sweetheart."</p>
<p>"Never fear, mistress," responded Jennie. "I will have a fine
story for the master."</p>
<p>Dorothy crouched inside the wall under the shadow of a bush, and
Jennie waited on the top of the stile. Sir George, thinking the
girl was Dorothy, lost no time in approaching her. He caught her
roughly by the arm and turned her around that he might see her
face.</p>
<p>"By God, Guild," he muttered, "I have made a mistake. I thought
the girl was Doll."</p>
<p>He left instantly and followed Guild and the servant to the
kitchen door. When Sir George left the stile, Dorothy hastened back
to the postern of which she had the key, and hurried toward her
room. She reached the door of her father's room just in time to see
Sir George and Guild enter it. They saw her, and supposed her to be
myself. If she hesitated, she was lost. But Dorothy never
hesitated. To think, with her, was to act. She did not of course
know that I was still in her apartments. She took the chance,
however, and boldly followed Sir John Guild into her father's room.
There she paused for a moment that she might not appear to be in
too great haste, and then entered Aunt Dorothy's room where I was
seated, waiting for her.</p>
<p>"Dorothy, my dear child," exclaimed Lady Crawford, clasping her
arms about Dorothy's neck.</p>
<p>"There is no time to waste in sentiment, Aunt Dorothy,"
responded the girl. "Here are your sword and cloak, Mal<a name=
"Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>colm. I thank you for their use. Don
them quickly." I did so, and walked into Sir George's room, where
that worthy old gentleman was dressing a slight wound in the hand.
I stopped to speak with him; but he seemed disinclined to talk, and
I left the room. He soon went to the upper court, and I presently
followed him.</p>
<p>Dorothy changed her garments, and she, Lady Crawford, and Madge
also came to the upper court. The braziers in the courtyard had
been lighted and cast a glare over two score half-clothed men and
women who had been aroused from their beds by the commotion of the
conflict on the hillside. Upon the upper steps of the courtyard
stood Sir George and Jennie Faxton.</p>
<p>"Who was the man you were with?" roughly demanded Sir George of
the trembling Jennie. Jennie's trembling was assumed for the
occasion.</p>
<p>"I will not tell you his name," she replied with tears. "He is
my sweetheart, and I will never come to the Hall again. Matters
have come to a pretty pass when a maiden cannot speak with her
sweetheart at the stile without he is set upon and beaten as if he
were a hedgehog. My father is your leal henchman, and his daughter
deserves better treatment at your hands than you have given
me."</p>
<p>"There, there!" said Sir George, placing his hand upon her head.
"I was in the wrong. I did not know you had a sweetheart who wore a
sword. When I saw you at the stile, I was sure you were another. I
am glad I was wrong." So was Dorothy glad.</p>
<p>"Everybody be off to bed," said Sir George. "Ben Shaw, see that
the braziers are all blackened."</p>
<p>Dorothy, Madge, and Lady Crawford returned to the latter's room,
and Sir George and I entered after them. He was evidently softened
in heart by the night's adventures and by the mistake he supposed
he had made.</p>
<p><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>A selfish man grows hard
toward those whom he injures. A generous heart grows tender. Sir
George was generous, and the injustice he thought he had done to
Dorothy made him eager to offer amends. The active evil in all Sir
George's wrong-doing was the fact that he conscientiously thought
he was in the right. Many a man has gone to hell
backward&mdash;with his face honestly toward heaven. Sir George had
not spoken to Dorothy since the scene wherein the key to Bowling
Green Gate played so important a part.</p>
<p>"Doll," said Sir George, "I thought you were at the stile with a
man. I was mistaken. It was the Faxton girl. I beg your pardon, my
daughter. I did you wrong."</p>
<p>"You do me wrong in many matters, father," replied Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Perhaps I do," her father returned, "perhaps I do, but I mean
for the best. I seek your happiness."</p>
<p>"You take strange measures at times, father, to bring about my
happiness," she replied.</p>
<p>"Whom God loveth He chasteneth," replied Sir George,
dolefully.</p>
<p>"That manner of loving may be well enough for God," retorted
Dorothy with no thought of irreverence, "but for man it is
dangerous. Whom man loves he should cherish. A man who has a good,
obedient daughter&mdash;one who loves him&mdash;will not imprison
her, and, above all, he will not refuse to speak to her, nor will
he cause her to suffer and to weep for lack of that love which is
her right. A man has no right to bring a girl into this world and
then cause her to suffer as you&mdash;as you&mdash;"</p>
<p>She ceased speaking and sought refuge in silent feminine
eloquence&mdash;tears. One would have sworn she had been grievously
injured that night.</p>
<p>"But I am older than you, Doll, and I know what is best for your
happiness," said Sir George.</p>
<p>"There are some things, father, which a girl knows with <a name=
"Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>better, surer knowledge than the
oldest man living. Solomon was wise because he had so many wives
from whom he could absorb wisdom."</p>
<p>"Ah, well!" answered Sir George, smiling in spite of himself,
"you will have the last word."</p>
<p>"Confess, father," she retorted quickly, "that you want the last
word yourself."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I do want it, but I'll never have it," returned Sir
George; "kiss me, Doll, and be my child again."</p>
<p>"That I will right gladly," she answered, throwing her arms
about her father's neck and kissing him with real affection. Then
Sir George said good night and started to leave. At the door he
stopped, and stood for a little time in thought.</p>
<p>"Dorothy," said he, speaking to Lady Crawford, "I relieve you of
your duty as a guard over Doll. She may go and come when she
chooses."</p>
<p>"I thank you, George," said Aunt Dorothy. "The task has been
painful to me."</p>
<p>Dorothy went to her father and kissed him again, and Sir George
departed.</p>
<p>When the door was closed, Lady Crawford breathed a great sigh
and said: "I thank Heaven, Dorothy, he does not know that you have
been out of your room. How could you treat me so cruelly? How could
you deceive me?"</p>
<p>"That, Aunt Dorothy," replied the niece, "is because you are not
old enough yet to be a match for a girl who is&mdash;who is in
love."</p>
<p>"Shame upon you, Dorothy!" said Lady Crawford. "Shame upon you,
to act as you did, and now to speak so plainly about being in love!
Malcolm said you were not a modest girl, and I am beginning to
believe him."</p>
<p>"Did Malcolm speak so ill of me?" asked Dorothy, turning toward
me with a smile in her eyes.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>My lady aunt," said I,
turning to Lady Crawford, "when did I say that Dorothy was an
immodest girl?"</p>
<p>"You did not say it," the old lady admitted. "Dorothy herself
said it, and she proves her words to be true by speaking so boldly
of her feelings toward this&mdash;this strange man. And she speaks
before Madge, too."</p>
<p>"Perhaps Madge is in the same sort of trouble. Who knows?" cried
Dorothy, laughing heartily. Madge blushed painfully. "But,"
continued Dorothy, seriously, "I am not ashamed of it; I am proud
of it. For what else, my dear aunt, was I created but to be in
love? Tell me, dear aunt, for what else was I created?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps you are right," returned the old lady, who in fact was
sentimentally inclined.</p>
<p>"The chief end of woman, after all, is to love," said Dorothy.
"What would become of the human race if it were not?"</p>
<p>"Child, child," cried the aunt, "where learned you such
things?"</p>
<p>"They were written upon my mother's breast," continued Dorothy,
"and I learned them when I took in my life with her milk. I pray
they may be written upon my breast some day, if God in His goodness
shall ever bless me with a baby girl. A man child could not read
the words."</p>
<p>"Dorothy, Dorothy!" cried Lady Crawford, "you shock me. You pain
me."</p>
<p>"Again I ask," responded Dorothy, "for what else was I created?
I tell you, Aunt Dorothy, the world decrees that women shall remain
in ignorance, or in pretended ignorance&mdash;in silence at
least&mdash;regarding the things concerning which they have the
greatest need to be wise and talkative."</p>
<p>"At your age, Dorothy, I did not have half your wisdom on the
subject," answered Lady Crawford.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>Tell me, my sweet Aunt
Dorothy, were you really in a state of ignorance such as you would
have me believe?"</p>
<p>"Well," responded the old lady, hesitatingly, "I did not speak
of such matters."</p>
<p>"Why, aunt, did you not?" asked Dorothy. "Were you ashamed of
what God had done? Were you ashamed of His great purpose in
creating you a woman, and in creating your mother and your mother's
mother before you?"</p>
<p>"No, no, child; no, no. But I cannot argue with you. Perhaps you
are right," said Aunt Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Then tell me, dear aunt, that I am not immodest and bold when I
speak concerning that of which my heart is full to overflowing. God
put it there, aunt, not I. Surely I am not immodest by reason of
His act."</p>
<p>"No, no, my sweet child," returned Aunt Dorothy, beginning to
weep softly. "No, no, you are not immodest. You are worth a
thousand weak fools such as I was at your age."</p>
<p>Poor Aunt Dorothy had been forced into a marriage which had
wrecked her life. Dorothy's words opened her aunt's eyes to the
fact that the girl whom she so dearly loved was being thrust by Sir
George into the same wretched fate through which she had dragged
her own suffering heart for so many years. From that hour she was
Dorothy's ally.</p>
<p>"Good night, Malcolm," said Lady Crawford, offering me her hand.
I kissed it tenderly; then I kissed the sweet old lady's cheek and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I love you with all my heart, Aunt Dorothy."</p>
<p>"I thank you, Malcolm," she returned.</p>
<p>I took my leave, and soon Madge went to her room, leaving
Dorothy and Lady Crawford together.</p>
<p>When Madge had gone the two Dorothys, one at each end of life,
spanned the long years that separated them, <a name="Page_219" id=
"Page_219"></a>and became one in heart by reason of a heartache
common to both.</p>
<p>Lady Crawford seated herself and Dorothy knelt by her chair.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Dorothy," said the old lady, "tell me, do you love
this man so tenderly, so passionately that you cannot give him
up?"</p>
<p>"Ah, my dear aunt," the girl responded, "words cannot tell. You
cannot know what I feel."</p>
<p>"Alas! I know only too well, my child. I, too, loved a man when
I was your age, and none but God knows what I suffered when I was
forced by my parents and the priests to give him up, and to wed one
whom&mdash;God help me&mdash;I loathed."</p>
<p>"Oh, my sweet aunt!" cried Dorothy softly, throwing her arms
about the old lady's neck and kissing her cheek. "How terribly you
must have suffered!"</p>
<p>"Yes," responded Lady Crawford, "and I am resolved you shall not
endure the same fate. I hope the man who has won your love is
worthy of you. Do not tell me his name, for I do not wish to
practise greater deception toward your father than I must. But you
may tell me of his station in life, and of his person, that I may
know he is not unworthy of you."</p>
<p>"His station in life," answered Dorothy, "is far better than
mine. In person he is handsome beyond any woman's wildest dream of
manly beauty. In character he is noble, generous, and good. He is
far beyond my deserts, Aunt Dorothy."</p>
<p>"Then why does he not seek your hand from your father?" asked
the aunt.</p>
<p>"That I may not tell you, Aunt Dorothy," returned the girl,
"unless you would have me tell you his name, and that I dare not
do. Although he is vastly my superior in station, in blood, and in
character, still my father would <a name="Page_220" id=
"Page_220"></a>kill me before he would permit me to marry this man
of my choice; and I, dear aunt, fear I shall die if I have him
not."</p>
<p>Light slowly dawned upon Aunt Dorothy's mind, and she exclaimed
in a terrified whisper:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My God, child, is it he?"</p>
<p>"Yes," responded the girl, "yes, it is he."</p>
<p>"Do not speak his name, Dorothy," the old lady said. "Do not
speak his name. So long as you do not tell me, I cannot know with
certainty who he is." After a pause Aunt Dorothy continued,
"Perhaps, child, it was his father whom I loved and was compelled
to give up."</p>
<p>"May the blessed Virgin pity us, sweet aunt," cried Dorothy,
caressingly.</p>
<p>"And help us," returned Lady Crawford. "I, too, shall help you,"
she continued. "It will be through no fault of mine if your life is
wasted as mine has been."</p>
<p>Dorothy kissed her aunt and retired.</p>
<p>Next morning when Dorothy arose a song came from her heart as it
comes from the skylark when it sees the sun at dawn&mdash;because
it cannot help singing. It awakened Aunt Dorothy, and she began to
live her life anew, in brightness, as she steeped her soul in the
youth and joyousness of Dorothy Vernon's song.</p>
<p>I have spoken before in this chronicle of Will Dawson. He was a
Conformer. Possibly it was by reason of his religious faith that he
did not share the general enmity that existed in Haddon Hall
against the house of Rutland. He did not, at the time of which I
speak, know Sir John Manners, and he did not suspect that the heir
to Rutland was the man who had of late been causing so much trouble
to the house of Vernon. At least, if he did suspect it, no one knew
of his suspicions.</p>
<p>Sir George made a great effort to learn who the mysterious
interloper was, but he wholly failed to obtain any clew <a name=
"Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>to his identity. He had jumped to the
conclusion that Dorothy's mysterious lover was a man of low degree.
He had taken for granted that he was an adventurer whose station
and person precluded him from openly wooing his daughter. He did
not know that the heir to Rutland was in the Derbyshire country;
for John, after his first meeting with Dorothy, had carefully
concealed his presence from everybody save the inmates of Rutland.
In fact, his mission to Rutland required secrecy, and the Rutland
servants and retainers were given to understand as much. Even had
Sir George known of John's presence at Rutland, the old gentleman's
mind could not have compassed the thought that Dorothy, who, he
believed, hated the race of Manners with an intensity equalled only
by his own feelings, could be induced to exchange a word with a
member of the house. His uncertainty was not the least of his
troubles; and although Dorothy had full liberty to come and go at
will, her father kept constant watch over her. As a matter of fact,
Sir George had given Dorothy liberty partly for the purpose of
watching her, and he hoped to discover thereby and, if possible, to
capture the man who had brought trouble to his household. Sir
George had once hanged a man to a tree on Bowling Green Hill by no
other authority than his own desire. That execution was the last in
England under the old Saxon law of Infangthef and Outfangthef. Sir
George had been summoned before Parliament for the deed; but the
writ had issued against the King of the Peak, and that being only a
sobriquet, was neither Sir George's name nor his title. So the writ
was quashed, and the high-handed act of personal justice was not
farther investigated by the authorities. Should my cousin capture
his daughter's lover, there would certainly be another execution
under the old Saxon law. So you see that my friend Manners was
tickling death with a straw for Dorothy's sake.</p>
<p><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>One day Dawson approached
Sir George and told him that a man sought employment in the
household of Haddon Hall. Sir George placed great confidence in his
forester; so he told Dawson to employ the man if his services were
needed. The new servant proved to be a fine, strong fellow, having
a great shock of carrot-colored hair and a bushy beard of rusty
red.</p>
<p>Dawson engaged the newcomer, and assigned to him the duty of
kindling the fires in the family apartments of the Hall. The name
of the new servant was Thomas Thompson, a name that Dorothy soon
abbreviated to Tom-Tom.</p>
<p>One day she said to him, by way of opening the acquaintance,
"Thomas, you and I should be good friends; we have so much in
common."</p>
<p>"Thank you, my lady," responded Thomas, greatly pleased. "I hope
we shall be good friends; indeed, indeed I do, but I cannot tell
wherein I am so fortunate as to have anything in common with your
Ladyship. What is it, may I ask, of which we have so much in
common?"</p>
<p>"So much hair," responded Dorothy, laughing.</p>
<p>"It were blasphemy, lady, to compare my hair with yours,"
returned Thomas. "Your hair, I make sure, is such as the blessed
Virgin had. I ask your pardon for speaking so plainly; but your
words put the thought into my mind, and perhaps they gave me
license to speak."</p>
<p>Thomas was on his knees, placing wood upon the fire.</p>
<p>"Thomas," returned Dorothy, "you need never apologize to a lady
for making so fine a speech. I declare a courtier could not have
made a better one."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I have lived among courtiers, lady," said Thomas.</p>
<p>"I doubt not," replied Dorothy, derisively. "You would have me
believe you are above your station. It is the way <a name=
"Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>with all new servants. I suppose you
have seen fine company and better days."</p>
<p>"I have never seen finer company than now, and I have never
known better days than this," responded courtier Thomas. Dorothy
thought he was presuming on her condescension, and was about to
tell him so when he continued: "The servants at Haddon Hall are
gentlefolk compared with servants at other places where I have
worked, and I desire nothing more than to find favor in Sir
George's eyes. I would do anything to achieve that end."</p>
<p>Dorothy was not entirely reassured by Thomas's closing words;
but even if they were presumptuous, she admired his wit in giving
them an inoffensive turn. From that day forth the acquaintance grew
between the servant and mistress until it reached the point of
familiarity at which Dorothy dubbed him Tom-Tom.</p>
<p>Frequently Dorothy was startled by remarks made by Thomas,
having in them a strong dash of familiarity; but he always gave to
his words a harmless turn before she could resent them. At times,
however, she was not quite sure of his intention.</p>
<p>Within a week after Thomas's advent to the hall, Dorothy began
to suspect that the new servant looked upon her with eyes of great
favor. She frequently caught him watching her, and at such times
his eyes, which Dorothy thought were really very fine, would glow
with an ardor all too evident. His manner was cause for amusement
rather than concern, and since she felt kindly toward the new
servant, she thought to create a faithful ally by treating him
graciously. She might, she thought, need Thomas's help when the
time should come for her to leave Haddon Hall with John, if that
happy time should ever come. She did not realize that the most
dangerous, watchful enemy to her cherished scheme would be a
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>man who was himself in love
with her, even though he were a servant, and she looked on Thomas's
evident infatuation with a smile. She did not once think that in
the end it might cause her great trouble, so she accepted his mute
admiration, and thought to make use of it later on. To Tom,
therefore, Dorothy was gracious.</p>
<p>John had sent word to Dorothy, by Jennie Faxton, that he had
gone to London, and would be there for a fortnight or more.</p>
<p>Sir George had given permission to his daughter to ride out
whenever she wished to do so, but he had ordered that Dawson or I
should follow in the capacity of spy, and Dorothy knew of the
censorship, though she pretended ignorance of it. So long as John
was in London she did not care who followed her; but I well knew
that when Manners should return, Dorothy would again begin
manoeuvring, and that by some cunning trick she would see him.</p>
<p>One afternoon I was temporarily absent from the Hall and Dorothy
wished to ride. Dawson was engaged, and when Dorothy had departed,
he ordered Tom to ride after his mistress at a respectful distance.
Nearly a fortnight had passed since John had gone to London, and
when Dorothy rode forth that afternoon she was beginning to hope he
might have returned, and that by some delightful possibility he
might then be loitering about the old trysting-place at Bowling
Green Gate. There was a half-unconscious conviction in her heart
that he would be there. She determined therefore, to ride toward
Rowsley, to cross the Wye at her former fording-place, and to go up
to Bowling Green Gate on the Devonshire side of the Haddon wall.
She had no reason, other than the feeling born of her wishes, to
believe that John would be there; but she loved the spot for the
sake of the memories which hovered about it. She well knew that
some one would follow her from the Hall; but she felt sure that in
case the spy<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a> proved to be
Dawson or myself, she could easily arrange matters to her
satisfaction, if by good fortune she should find her lover at the
gate.</p>
<p>Tom rode so far behind his mistress that she could not determine
who was following her. Whenever she brought Dolcy to a walk,
Tom-Tom also walked his horse. When Dorothy galloped, he galloped;
but after Dorothy had crossed the Wye and had taken the wall over
into the Devonshire lands, Tom also crossed the river and wall and
quickly rode to her side. He uncovered and bowed low with a
familiarity of manner that startled her. The act of riding up to
her and the manner in which he took his place by her side were
presumptuous to the point of insolence, and his attitude, although
not openly offensive, was slightly alarming. She put Dolcy to a
gallop; but the servant who, she thought, was presuming on her
former graciousness, kept close at Dolcy's heels. The man was a
stranger, and she knew nothing of his character. She was alone in
the forest with him, and she did not know to what length his absurd
passion for her might lead him. She was alarmed, but she despised
cowardice, although she knew herself to be a coward, and she
determined to ride to the gate, which was but a short distance
ahead of her. She resolved that if the insolent fellow continued
his familiarity, she would teach him a lesson he would never
forget. When she was within a short distance of the gate she sprang
from Dolcy and handed her rein to her servant. John was not there,
but she went to the gate in the hope that a letter might be hidden
beneath the stone bench where Jennie was wont to find them in times
past. Dorothy found no letter, but she could not resist the
temptation to sit down upon the bench where he and she had sat, and
to dream over the happy moments she had spent there. Tom, instead
of holding the horses, hitched them, and walked toward Dorothy.
That act on <a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>the part of her
servant was effrontery of the most insolent sort. Will Dawson
himself would not have dared do such a thing. It filled her with
alarm, and as Tom approached she was trying to determine in what
manner she would crush him. But when the audacious Thomas, having
reached the gate, seated himself beside his mistress on the stone
bench, the girl sprang to her feet in fright and indignation. She
began to realize the extent of her foolhardiness in going to that
secluded spot with a stranger.</p>
<p>"How dare you approach me in this insolent fashion?" cried
Dorothy, breathless with fear.</p>
<p>"Mistress Vernon," responded Thomas, looking boldly up into her
pale face, "I wager you a gold pound sterling that if you permit me
to remain here by your side ten minutes you will be
unwilling&mdash;"</p>
<p>"John, John!" cried the girl, exultantly. Tom snatched the red
beard from his face, and Dorothy, after one fleeting, luminous look
into his eyes, fell upon her knees and buried her face in her
hands. She wept, and John, bending over the kneeling girl, kissed
her sunlit hair.</p>
<p>"Cruel, cruel," sobbed Dorothy. Then she lifted her head and
clasped her hands about his neck. "Is it not strange," she
continued, "that I should have felt so sure of seeing you? My
reason kept telling me that my hopes were absurd, but a stronger
feeling full of the breath of certainty seemed to assure me that
you would be here. It impelled me to come, though I feared you
after we crossed the wall. But reason, fear, and caution were
powerless to keep me away."</p>
<p>"You did not know my voice," said John, "nor did you penetrate
my disguise. You once said that you would recognize me though I
wore all the petticoats in Derbyshire."</p>
<p>"Please don't jest with me now," pleaded Dorothy. "I cannot bear
it. Great joy is harder to endure than great grief. Why did you not
reveal yourself to me at the Hall?" she asked plaintively.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>I found no opportunity,"
returned John, "others were always present."</p>
<p>I shall tell you nothing that followed. It is no affair of yours
nor of mine.</p>
<p>They were overjoyed in being together once more. Neither of them
seemed to realize that John, while living under Sir George's roof,
was facing death every moment. To Dorothy, the fact that John, who
was heir to one of England's noblest houses, was willing for her
sake to become a servant, to do a servant's work, and to receive
the indignities constantly put upon a servant, appealed most
powerfully. It added to her feeling for him a tenderness which is
not necessarily a part of passionate love.</p>
<p>It is needless for me to tell you that while John performed
faithfully the duty of keeping bright the fires in Haddon Hall, he
did not neglect the other flame&mdash;the one in Dorothy's
heart&mdash;for the sake of whose warmth he had assumed the
leathern garb of servitude and had placed his head in the lion's
mouth.</p>
<p>At first he and Dorothy used great caution in exchanging words
and glances, but familiarity with danger breeds contempt for it. So
they utilized every opportunity that niggard chance offered, and
blinded by their great longing soon began to make opportunities for
speech with each other, thereby bringing trouble to Dorothy and
deadly peril to John. Of that I shall soon tell you.</p>
<p>During the period of John's service in Haddon Hall negotiations
for Dorothy's marriage with Lord Stanley were progressing slowly
but surely. Arrangements for the marriage settlement by the
Stanleys, and for Dorothy's dower to be given by Sir George, were
matters that the King of the Peak approached boldly as he would
have met any other affair of business. But the Earl of Derby, whose
mind moved slowly, desiring that a generous portion of the Vernon
wealth should be transferred with Dorothy <a name="Page_228" id=
"Page_228"></a>to the Stanley holdings without the delay incident
to Sir George's death, put off signing the articles of marriage in
his effort to augment the cash payment. In truth, the great wealth
which Dorothy would bring to the house of Stanley was the earl's
real reason for desiring her marriage with his son. The earl was
heavily in debt, and his estate stood in dire need of help.</p>
<p>Sir George, though attracted by the high nobility of the house
of Stanley, did not relish the thought that the wealth he had
accumulated by his own efforts, and the Vernon estates which had
come down to him through centuries, should go to pay Lord Derby's
debts. He therefore insisted that Dorothy's dower should be her
separate estate, and demanded that it should remain untouched and
untouchable by either of the Stanleys. That arrangement did not
suit my lord earl, and although the son since he had seen Dorothy
at Derby-town was eager to possess the beautiful girl, his father
did not share his ardor. Lawyers were called in who looked
expensively wise, but they accomplished the purpose for which they
were employed. An agreement of marriage was made and was drawn up
on an imposing piece of parchment, brave with ribbons, pompous with
seals, and fair in clerkly penmanship.</p>
<p>One day Sir George showed me the copy of the contract which had
been prepared for him. That evening at the cost of much labor he
and I went over the indenture word for word, and when we had
finished Sir George thought it was very good indeed. He seemed to
think that all difficulties in the way of the marriage were
overcome when the agreement that lay before us on the table had
been achieved between him and the earl. I knew Sir George's
troubles had only begun; for I was aware of a fact which it seemed
impossible for him to learn, though of late Dorothy had given him
much teaching thereto. I knew that he had transmitted to his
daughter a large portion of his own <a name="Page_229" id=
"Page_229"></a>fierce, stubborn, unbreakable will, and that in her
it existed in its most deadly form&mdash;the feminine. To me after
supper that night was assigned the task of reading and rereading
many times to Sir George the contents of the beautiful parchment.
When I would read a clause that particularly pleased my cousin, he
insisted on celebrating the event by drinking a mug of liquor drawn
from a huge leather stoup which sat upon the table between us. By
the time I had made several readings of the interesting document
the characters began to mingle in a way that did not impart ease
and clearness to my style. Some of the strange combinations which I
and the liquor extracted from amid the seals and ribbons puzzled
Sir George not a little. But with each new libation he found new
clauses and fresh causes for self-congratulation, though to speak
exact truth I more than once married Sir George to the Earl of
Derby, and in my profanity gave Lord James Stanley to the devil to
have and to hold.</p>
<p>Sir George was rapidly falling before his mighty enemy, drink,
and I was not far behind him, though I admit the fault with shame.
My cousin for a while was mightily pleased with the contract; but
when the liquor had brought him to a point where he was entirely
candid with himself, he let slip the fact that after all there was
regret at the bottom of the goblet, metaphorically and actually.
Before his final surrender to drink he dropped the immediate
consideration of the contract and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Malcolm, I have in my time known many fools, but if you will
permit an old man, who loves you dearly, to make a plain statement
of his conviction&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Certainly," I interrupted.</p>
<p>"It would be a great relief to me," he continued, "to say that I
believe you to be the greatest fool the good God ever permitted to
live."</p>
<p>"I am sure, Sir George, that your condescending flattery is very
pleasing," I said.</p>
<p><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>Sir George, unmindful of my
remark, continued, "Your disease is not usually a deadly malady, as
a look about you will easily show; but, Malcolm, if you were one
whit more of a fool, you certainly would perish."</p>
<p>I was not offended, for I knew that my cousin meant no
offence.</p>
<p>"Then, Sir George, if the time ever comes when I wish to commit
suicide, I have always at hand an easy, painless mode of death. I
shall become only a little more of a fool." I laughingly said, "I
will do my utmost to absorb a little wisdom now and then as a
preventive."</p>
<p>"Never a bit of wisdom will you ever absorb. A man who would
refuse a girl whose wealth and beauty are as great as Dorothy's, is
past all hope. I often awaken in the dark corners of the night when
a man's troubles stalk about his bed like livid demons; and when I
think that all of this evil which has come up between Dorothy and
me, and all of this cursed estrangement which is eating out my
heart could have been averted if you had consented to marry her, I
cannot but feel&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But, Sir George," I interrupted, "it was Dorothy, not I, who
refused. She could never have been brought to marry me."</p>
<p>"Don't tell me, Malcolm; don't tell me," cried the old man,
angrily. Drink had made Sir George sullen and violent. It made me
happy at first; but with liquor in excess there always came to me a
sort of frenzy.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me," continued Sir George. "There never lived a
Vernon who couldn't win a woman if he would try. But put all that
aside. She would have obeyed me. I would have forced her to marry
you, and she would have thanked me afterward."</p>
<p>"You could never have forced her to marry me," I replied.</p>
<p>"But that I could and that I would have done," said Sir George.
"The like is done every day. Girls in these <a name="Page_231" id=
"Page_231"></a>modern times are all perverse, but they are made to
yield. Take the cases of Sir Thomas Mobley, Sir Grant Rhodas, and
William Kimm. Their daughters all refused to marry the men chosen
for them, but the wenches were made to yield. If I had a daughter
who refused to obey me, I would break her; I would break her. Yes,
by God, I would break her if I had to kill her," and the old man
brought his clenched hand down upon the oak table with a crash. His
eyes glared frightfully, and his face bore a forbidding expression
which boded no good for Dorothy.</p>
<p>"She will make trouble in this matter," Sir George continued,
tapping the parchment with his middle finger.</p>
<p>"She will make trouble about this; but, by God, Malcolm, she
shall obey me."</p>
<p>He struck the oaken table another great blow with his fist, and
glared fiercely across at me.</p>
<p>"Lord Wyatt had trouble with his daughter when he made the
marriage with Devonshire," continued Sir George.</p>
<p>"A damned good match it was, too, for the girl. But she had her
heart set on young Gillman, and she refused to obey her father. She
refused, by God, point blank, to obey her father. She refused to
obey the man who had given her life. What did Wyatt do? He was a
man who knew what a child owes to its father, and, by God, Malcolm,
after trying every other means to bring the wench to her senses,
after he had tried persuasion, after having in two priests and a
bishop to show her how badly she was acting, and after he had tried
to reason with her, he whipped her; yes, he whipped her till she
bled&mdash;till she bled, Malcolm, I tell you. Ah, Wyatt knew what
is due from a child to its parents. The whipping failed to bring
the perverse huzzy to obedience, so Wyatt threw her into a dungeon
and starved her till&mdash;till&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Till she died," I interrupted.</p>
<p>"Yes, till she died," mumbled Sir George, sullenly, "till she
died, and it served her right, by God, served her right."</p>
<p><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>The old man was growing
very drunk, and everything was beginning to appear distorted to me.
Sir George rose to his feet, leaned toward me with glaring eyes,
struck the table a terrible blow with his fist, and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"By the blood of God I swear that if Doll refuses to marry
Stanley, and persists in her refusal, I'll whip her. Wyatt is a man
after my own heart. I'll starve her. I'll kill her. Ay, if I loved
her ten thousand times more than I do, I would kill her or she
should obey me."</p>
<p>Then dawned upon me a vision of terrible possibilities. I was
sure Sir George could not force Dorothy to marry against her will;
but I feared lest he might kill her in his effort to "break her." I
do not mean that I feared he would kill her by a direct act, unless
he should do so in a moment of frenzy induced by drink and passion,
but I did fear for the results of the breaking process. The like
had often happened. It had happened in the case of Wyatt's
daughter. Dorothy under the intoxicating influence of her passion
might become so possessed by the spirit of a martyr that she could
calmly take a flogging, but my belief was that should matters
proceed to that extreme, should Sir George flog his daughter, the
chords of her highly strung nature would snap under the tension,
and she would die. I loved Dorothy for the sake of her fierce,
passionate, tender heart, and because she loved me; and even in my
sober, reflective moments I had resolved that my life, ay, and Sir
George's life also, should stand between the girl and the lash. If
in calmness I could deliberately form such a resolution, imagine
the effect on my liquor-crazed brain of Sir George's words and the
vista of horrors they disclosed. I was intoxicated. I was drunk. I
say it with shame; and on hearing Sir George's threat my
half-frenzied imagination ran riot into the foreboding future.</p>
<p>All the candles, save one tottering wick, were dead in their
sockets, and the room was filled with lowering phan<a name=
"Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>tom-like shadows from oaken floor to
grimy vaulted roof beams. Sir George, hardly conscious of what he
did and said, all his evil passions quickened with drink, leaned
his hands upon the table and glared across at me. He seemed to be
the incarnation of rage and ferocity, to so great a pitch had he
wrought himself. The sputtering candle feebly flickered, and seemed
to give its dim light only that the darksome shadows might flit and
hover about us like vampires on the scent of blood. A cold
perspiration induced by a nameless fear came upon me, and in that
dark future to which my heated imagination travelled I saw, as if
revealed by black magic, fair, sweet, generous Dorothy, standing
piteously upon Bowling Green hillside. Over her drooping form there
hung in air a monster cloudlike image of her father holding in its
hand a deadly bludgeon. So black, so horrid was this shadow-demon
that I sprang from my chair with a frightful oath, and
shrieked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Hell is made for man because of his cruelty to woman."</p>
<p>Sir George had sunk into his chair. Liquor had finished its
work, and the old man, resting his head upon his folded arms,
leaned forward on the table. He was drunk&mdash;dead to the world.
How long I stood in frenzied stupor gazing at shadow-stricken
Dorothy upon the hillside I do not know. It must have been several
minutes. Blood of Christ, how vividly I remember the vision! The
sunny radiance of the girl's hair was darkened and dead. Her
bending attitude was one of abject grief. Her hands covered her
face, and she was the image of woe. Suddenly she lifted her head
with the quick impulsive movement so familiar in her, and with a
cry eloquent as a child's wail for its mother called, "John," and
held out her arms imploringly toward the dim shadowy form of her
lover standing upon the hill crest. Then John's form began to fade,
and as its shadowy essence grew dim, <a name="Page_234" id=
"Page_234"></a>despair slowly stole like a mask of death over
Dorothy's face. She stood for a moment gazing vacantly into space.
Then she fell to the ground, the shadow of her father hovering over
her prostrate form, and the words, "Dead, dead, dead," came to me
in horrifying whispers from every dancing shadow-demon in the
room.</p>
<p>In trying to locate the whispers as they reverberated from floor
to oaken rafters, I turned and saw Sir George. He looked as if he
were dead.</p>
<p>"Why should you not be dead in fact?" I cried. "You would kill
your daughter. Why should I not kill you? That will solve the whole
question."</p>
<p>I revelled in the thought; I drank it in; I nursed it; I cuddled
it; I kissed it. Nature's brutish love for murder had deluged my
soul. I put my hand to my side for the purpose of drawing my sword
or my knife. I had neither with me. Then I remember staggering
toward the fireplace to get one of the fire-irons with which to
kill my cousin. I remember that when I grasped the fire-iron, by
the strange working of habit I employed it for the moment in its
proper use; and as I began to stir the embers on the hearth, my
original purpose was forgotten. That moment of habit-wrought
forgetfulness saved me and saved Sir George's life. I remember that
I sank into the chair in front of the fireplace, holding the iron,
and I thank God that I remember nothing more.</p>
<p>During the night the servants aroused me, and I staggered up the
stone stairway of Eagle Tower and clambered into my room.</p>
<p>The next morning I awakened feeling ill. There was a taste in my
mouth as If I had been chewing a piece of the devil's boot over
night. I wanted no breakfast, so I climbed to the top of the tower,
hoping the fresh morning breeze might cool my head and cleanse my
mouth. For a moment or two I stood on the tower roof bareheaded and
open-<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>mouthed while I drank in
the fresh, purifying air. The sweet draught helped me physically;
but all the winds of Boreas could not have blown out of my head the
vision of the previous night. The question, "Was it prophetic?"
kept ringing in my ears, answerless save by a superstitious feeling
of fear. Then the horrid thought that I had only by a mere chance
missed becoming a murderer came upon me, and again was crowded from
my mind by the memory of Dorothy and the hovering spectre which had
hung over her head on Bowling Green hillside.</p>
<p>I walked to the north side of the tower and on looking down the
first person I saw was our new servant, Thomas, holding two horses
at the mounting stand. One of them was Dolcy, and I, feeling that a
brisk ride with Dorothy would help me to throw off my wretchedness,
quickly descended the tower stairs, stopped at my room for my hat
and cloak, and walked around to the mounting block. Dorothy was
going to ride, and I supposed she would prefer me to the new
servant as a companion.</p>
<p>I asked Thomas if his mistress were going out for a ride, and he
replied affirmatively.</p>
<p>"Who is to accompany her?" I asked.</p>
<p>"She gave orders for me to go with her," he answered.</p>
<p>"Very well," I responded, "take your horse back to the stable
and fetch mine." The man hesitated, and twice he began to make
reply, but finally he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Very well, Sir Malcolm."</p>
<p>He hitched Dolcy to the ring in the mounting block and started
back toward the stable leading his own horse. At that moment
Dorothy came out of the tower gate, dressed for the ride. Surely no
woman was ever more beautiful than she that morning.</p>
<p>"Tom-Tom, where are you taking the horse?" she cried.</p>
<p>"To the stable, Mistress," answered the servant. "Sir Malcolm
says he will go with you."</p>
<p><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>Dorothy's joyousness
vanished. From radiant brightness her expression changed in the
twinkling of an eye to a look of disappointment so sorrowful that I
at once knew there was some great reason why she did not wish me to
ride with her. I could not divine the reason, neither did I try. I
quickly said to Thomas:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Do not bring my horse. If Mistress Vernon will excuse me, I
shall not ride with her this morning. I forgot for the moment that
I had not breakfasted."</p>
<p>Again came to Dorothy's face the radiant look of joy as if to
affirm what it had already told me. I looked toward Thomas, and his
eyes, too, were alight. I could make nothing of it. Thomas was a
fine-looking fellow, notwithstanding his preposterous hair and
beard; but I felt sure there could be no understanding between the
man and his mistress.</p>
<p>When Thomas and Dorothy had mounted, she timidly ventured to
say:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We are sorry, Cousin Malcolm, that you cannot ride with
us."</p>
<p>She did not give me an opportunity to change my mind, but struck
Dolcy a sharp blow with her whip that sent the spirited mare
galloping toward the dove-cote, and Thomas quickly followed at a
respectful distance. From the dove-cote Dorothy took the path down
the Wye toward Rowsley. I, of course, connected her strange conduct
with John. When a young woman who is well balanced physically,
mentally, and morally acts in a strange, unusual manner, you may
depend on it there is a man somewhere behind her motive.</p>
<p>I knew that John was in London. Only the night before I had
received word from Rutland Castle that he had not returned, and
that he was not expected home for many days.</p>
<p>So I concluded that John could not be behind my fair <a name=
"Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>cousin's motive. I tried to stop
guessing at the riddle Dorothy had set me, but my effort was
useless. I wondered and thought and guessed, but I brought to
myself only the answer, "Great is the mystery of womanhood."</p>
<p>After Dorothy had ridden away I again climbed to the top of
Eagle Tower and saw the riders cross the Wye at Dorothy's former
fording-place, and take the wall. I then did a thing that fills me
with shame when I think of it. For the only time in my whole life I
acted the part of a spy. I hurried to Bowling Green Gate, and
horror upon horror, there I beheld my cousin Dorothy in the arms of
Thomas, the man-servant. I do not know why the truth of Thomas's
identity did not dawn upon me, but it did not, and I stole away
from the gate, thinking that Dorothy, after all, was no better than
the other women I had known at various times in my life, and I
resolved to tell John what I had seen. You must remember that the
women I had known were of the courts of Mary Stuart and of Guise,
and the less we say about them the better. God pity them! Prior to
my acquaintance with Dorothy and Madge I had always considered a
man to be a fool who would put his faith in womankind. To me women
were as good as men,&mdash;no better, no worse. But with my
knowledge of those two girls there had grown up in me a faith in
woman's virtue which in my opinion is man's greatest comforter; the
lack of it his greatest torment.</p>
<p>I went back to Eagle Tower and stood at my window looking down
the Wye, hoping soon to see Dorothy returning home. I did not feel
jealousy in the sense that a lover would feel it; but there was a
pain in my heart, a mingling of grief, anger, and resentment
because Dorothy had destroyed not only my faith in her, but, alas!
my sweet, new-born faith in womankind. Through her fault I had
fallen again to my old, black belief that virtue was only another
name for the lack of opportunity. It is easy for a man <a name=
"Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>who has never known virtue in woman to
bear and forbear the lack of it; but when once he has known the
priceless treasure, doubt becomes excruciating pain.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="v238" id="v238"></a> <img src=
"images/v238.jpg" alt="" title="" /></div>
<p>After an hour or two Dorothy and her servant appeared at the
ford and took the path up the Wye toward Haddon. Thomas was riding
a short distance behind his accommodating mistress, and as they
approached the Hall, I recognized something familiar in his figure.
At first, the feeling of recognition was indistinct, but when the
riders drew near, something about the man&mdash;his poise on the
horse, a trick with the rein or a turn with his stirrup, I could
not tell what it was&mdash;startled me like a flash in the dark,
and the word "John!" sprang to my lips. The wonder of the thing
drove out of my mind all power to think. I could only feel happy,
so I lay down upon my bed and soon dropped off to sleep.</p>
<p>When I awakened I was rapt in peace, for I had again found my
treasured faith in womankind. I had hardly dared include Madge in
my backsliding, but I had come perilously near doing it, and the
thought of my narrow escape from such perfidy frightened me. I have
never taken the risk since that day. I would not believe the
testimony of my own eyes against the evidence of my faith in
Madge.</p>
<p>I knew that Thomas was Sir John Manners, and yet I did not know
it certainly. I determined, if possible, to remain in partial
ignorance, hoping that I might with some small show of truth be
able to plead ignorance should Sir George accuse me of bad faith in
having failed to tell him of John's presence in Haddon Hall. That
Sir George would sooner or later discover Thomas's identity I had
little doubt. That he would kill him should he once have him in his
power, I had no doubt at all. Hence, although I had awakened in
peace concerning Dorothy, you may understand that I awakened to
trouble concerning John.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a><a name="Page_239" id=
"Page_239"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2>THE COST MARK OF JOY</h2>
<p>Peace had been restored between Dorothy and her father. At least
an armistice had been tacitly declared. But, owing to Dorothy's
knowledge of her father's intention that she should marry Lord
Stanley, and because of Sir George's feeling that Dorothy had
determined to do nothing of the sort, the belligerent powers
maintained a defensive attitude which rendered an absolute
reconciliation impossible. They were ready for war at a moment's
notice.</p>
<p>The strangest part of their relation was the failure of each to
comprehend and fully to realize the full strength of the other's
purpose. Dorothy could not bring herself to believe that her
father, who had until within the last few weeks, been kind and
indulgent to her, seriously intended to force her into marriage
with a creature so despicable as Stanley. In fact, she did not
believe that her father could offer lasting resistance to her
ardent desire in any matter. Such an untoward happening had never
befallen her. Dorothy had learned to believe from agreeable
experience that it was a crime in any one, bordering on treason, to
thwart her ardent desires. It is true she had in certain events,
been compelled to coax and even to weep gently. On a few extreme
occasions she had been forced to do a little storming in order to
have her own way; but that any presumptuous individuals should
resist her will after the storming had <a name="Page_240" id=
"Page_240"></a>been resorted to was an event of such recent
happening in her life that she had not grown familiar with the
thought of it. Therefore, while she felt that her father might
seriously annoy her with the Stanley project, and while she
realized that she might be compelled to resort to the storming
process in a degree thitherto uncalled for, she believed that the
storm she would raise would blow her father entirely out of his
absurd and utterly untenable position. On the other hand, while Sir
George anticipated trouble with Dorothy, he had never been able to
believe that she would absolutely refuse to obey him. In those
olden times&mdash;now nearly half a century past&mdash;filial
disobedience was rare. The refusal of a child to obey a parent, and
especially the refusal of a daughter to obey her father in the
matter of marriage, was then looked upon as a crime and was
frequently punished in a way which amounted to barbarous ferocity.
Sons, being of the privileged side of humanity, might occasionally
disobey with impunity, but woe to the poor girl who dared set up a
will of her own. A man who could not compel obedience from his
daughter was looked upon as a poor weakling, and contempt was his
portion in the eyes of his fellow-men&mdash;in the eyes of his
fellow-brutes, I should like to say.</p>
<p>Growing out of such conditions was the firm belief on the part
of Sir George that Dorothy would in the end obey him; but if by any
hard chance she should be guilty of the high crime of
disobedience&mdash;Well! Sir George intended to prevent the crime.
Perhaps mere stubborness and fear of the contempt in which he would
be held by his friends in case he were defeated by his own daughter
were no small parts of Sir George's desire to carry through the
enterprise in which he had embarked with the Stanleys. Although
there was no doubt in Sir George's mind that he would eventually
conquer in the conflict with Dorothy, he had a profound respect for
the power of his antagonist <a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>to
do temporary battle, and he did not care to enter into actual
hostilities until hostilities should become actually necessary.</p>
<p>Therefore, upon the second day after I had read the beribboned,
besealed contract to Sir George, he sent an advance guard toward
the enemy's line. He placed the ornamental piece of parchment in
Lady Crawford's hands and directed her to give it to Dorothy.</p>
<p>But before I tell you of the parchment I must relate a scene
that occurred in Aunt Dorothy's room a few hours after I recognized
John as he rode up the Wye with Dorothy. It was late in the
afternoon of the day after I read the contract to Sir George and
saw the horrid vision on Bowling Green.</p>
<p>I was sitting with Madge at the west window of Dorothy's parlor.
We were watching the sun as it sank in splendor beneath Overhaddon
Hill.</p>
<p>I should like first to tell you a few words&mdash;only a few, I
pray you&mdash;concerning Madge and myself. I will.</p>
<p>I have just said that Madge and I were watching the sun at the
west window, and I told you but the truth, for Madge had learned to
see with my eyes. Gladly would I have given them to her outright,
and willingly would I have lived in darkness could I have given
light to her. She gave light to me&mdash;the light of truth, of
purity, and of exalted motive. There had been no words spoken by
Madge nor me to any one concerning the strange and holy chain that
was welding itself about us, save the partial confession which she
had whispered to Dorothy. But notwithstanding our silence, our
friends in the Hall understood that Madge and I were very dear to
each other. I, of course, saw a great deal of her; but it was the
evening hour at the west window to which I longingly looked forward
all the day. I am no poet, nor do my words and thoughts come with
the rhythmic flow and eloquent <a name="Page_242" id=
"Page_242"></a>imagery of one to whom the talent of poesy is given.
But during those evening hours it seemed that with the soft touch
of Madge's hand there ran through me a current of infectious
dreaming which kindled my soul till thoughts of beauty came to my
mind and words of music sprang to my lips such as I had always
considered not to be in me. It was not I who spoke; it was Madge
who saw with my eyes and spoke with my voice. To my vision, swayed
by Madge's subtle influence, the landscape became a thing of moving
beauty and of life, and the floating clouds became a panorama of
ever shifting pictures. I, inspired by her, described so eloquently
the wonders I saw that she, too, could see them. Now a flock of
white-winged angels rested on the low-hung azure of the sky,
watching the glory of Ph&oelig;bus as he drove his fiery steeds
over the western edge of the world. Again, Mount Olympus would grow
before my eyes, and I would plainly see Jove sitting upon his
burnished throne, while gods and goddesses floated at his feet and
revelled on the fleecy mountain sides. Then would mountain, gods,
and goddesses dissolve,&mdash;as in fact they did dissolve ages ago
before the eyes of millions who had thought them real,&mdash;and in
their places perhaps would come a procession of golden-maned lions,
at the description of which would Madge take pretended fright.
Again, would I see Madge herself in flowing white robes made of the
stuff from which fleecy clouds are wrought. All these wonders would
I describe, and when I would come to tell her of the fair cloud
image of herself I would seize the joyous chance to make her
understand in some faint degree how altogether lovely in my eyes
the vision was. Then would she smile and softly press my hand and
say:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Malcolm, it must be some one else you see in the cloud," though
she was pleased.</p>
<p>But when the hour was done then came the crowning <a name=
"Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>moment of the day, for as I would rise
to take my leave, if perchance we were alone, she would give
herself to my arms for one fleeting instant and willingly would her
lips await&mdash;but there are moments too sacred for aught save
holy thought. The theme is sweet to me, but I must go back to
Dorothy and tell you of the scene I have promised you.</p>
<p>As I have already said, it was the evening following that upon
which I had read the marriage contract to Sir George, and had seen
the vision on the hillside. Madge and I were sitting at the west
window. Dorothy, in kindness to us, was sitting alone by the
fireside in Lady Crawford's chamber. Thomas entered the room with
an armful of fagots, which he deposited in the fagot-holder. He was
about to replenish the fire, but Dorothy thrust him aside, and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You shall kindle no more fires for me. At least you shall not
do so when no one else is by. It pains me that you, at whose feet I
am unworthy to kneel, should be my servant"</p>
<p>Thereupon she took in her hands the fagot John had been holding.
He offered to prevent her, but she said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Please, John, let me do this."</p>
<p>The doors were open, and we heard all that was said by Dorothy
and Tom. Madge grasped my hand in surprise and fear.</p>
<p>"Please, John," said Dorothy, "if it gives me pleasure to be
your servant, you should not wish to deny me. There lives but one
person whom I would serve. There, John, I will give you another,
and you shall let me do as I will."</p>
<p>Dorothy, still holding the fagot in her hands, pressed it
against John's breast and gently pushed him backward toward a large
armchair, in which she had been sitting by the west side of the
fireplace.</p>
<p>"You sit there, John, and we will make believe that this is our
house, and that you have just come in very cold from <a name=
"Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>a ride, and that I am making a fine
fire to warm you. Isn't it pleasant, John? There, you sit and warm
yourself&mdash;my&mdash;my&mdash;husband," she said laughingly. "It
is fine sport even to play at. There is one fagot on the fire," she
said, as she threw the wood upon the embers, causing them to fly in
all directions. John started up to brush the scattered embers back
into the fireplace, but Dorothy stopped him.</p>
<p>"I will put them all back," she said. "You know you are cold and
very tired. You have been overseeing the tenantry and have been
hunting. Will you have a howl of punch, my&mdash;my husband?" and
she laughed again and kissed him as she passed to the holder for
another fagot.</p>
<p>"I much prefer that to punch," said John, laughing softly. "Have
you more?"</p>
<p>"Thousands of them, John, thousands of them." She rippled forth
a little laugh and continued: "I occupy my time nowadays in making
them that I may always have a great supply when we are&mdash;that
is, you know, when you&mdash;when the time comes that you may
require a great many to keep you in good humor." Again came the
laugh, merry and clear as the tinkle of sterling silver.</p>
<p>She laughed again within a minute or two; but when the second
laugh came, it sounded like a knell.</p>
<p>Dorothy delighted to be dressed in the latest fashion. Upon this
occasion she wore a skirt vast in width, of a pattern then much in
vogue. The sleeves also were preposterously large, in accordance
with the custom of the times. About her neck a beautiful white
linen ruff stood out at least the eighth part of an ell. The day
had been damp and cold, and the room in which she had been sitting
was chilly. For that reason, most fortunately, she had thrown over
her shoulders a wide sable cloak broad enough to enfold her many
times and long enough to reach nearly to her knees: Dorothy thus
arrayed was <a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>standing in front
of John's chair. She had just spoken the words "good humor," when
the door leading to her father's room opened and in walked Sir
George. She and her ample skirts and broad sleeves were between
John and the door. Not one brief instant did Dorothy waste in
thought. Had she paused to put in motion the machinery of reason,
John would have been lost. Thomas sitting in Lady Crawford's chair
and Dorothy standing beside him would have told Sir George all he
needed to know. He might not have discovered John's identity, but a
rope and a tree in Bowling Green would quickly have closed the
chapter of Dorothy's mysterious love affair. Dorothy, however, did
not stop to reason nor to think. She simply acted without
preliminary thought, as the rose unfolds or as the lightning
strikes. She quietly sat down upon John's knees, leaned closely
back against him, spread out the ample folds of her skirt, threw
the lower parts of her broad cape over her shoulders and across the
back of the chair, and Sir John Manners was invisible to mortal
eyes.</p>
<p>"Come in, father," said Dorothy, in dulcet tones that should
have betrayed her.</p>
<p>"I heard you laughing and talking," said Sir George, "and I
wondered who was with you."</p>
<p>"I was talking to Madge and Malcolm who are in the other room,"
replied Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Did not Thomas come in with fagots?" asked Sir George.</p>
<p>"I think he is replenishing the fire in the parlor, father, or
he may have gone out. I did not notice. Do you want him?"</p>
<p>"I do not especially want him," Sir George answered.</p>
<p>"When he finishes in the parlor I will tell him that you want
him," said Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Very well," replied Sir George.</p>
<p><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>He returned to his room,
but he did not close the door.</p>
<p>The moment her father's back was turned Dorothy
called:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Tom&mdash;Tom, father wants you," and instantly Thomas was
standing deferentially by her side, and she was seated in the great
chair. It was a rapid change, I assure you. But a man's life and
his fortune for good or ill often hang upon a tiny peg&mdash;a
second of time protruding from the wall of eternity. It serves him
briefly; but if he be ready for the vital instant, it may serve him
well.</p>
<p>"Yes, mistress," said Thomas, "I go to him at once."</p>
<p>John left the room and closed the door as he passed out. Then it
was that Dorothy's laugh sounded like the chilling tones of a
knell. It was the laugh of one almost distraught. She came to Madge
and me laughing, but the laugh quickly changed to convulsive sobs.
The strain of the brief moment during which her father had been in
Lady Crawford's room had been too great for even her strong nerves
to bear. She tottered and would have fallen had I not caught her. I
carried her to the bed, and Madge called Lady Crawford. Dorothy had
swooned.</p>
<p>When she wakened she said dreamily:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I shall always keep this cloak and gown."</p>
<p>Aunt Dorothy thought the words were but the incoherent
utterances of a dimly conscious mind, but I knew they were the
deliberate expression of a justly grateful heart.</p>
<p>The following evening trouble came about over the matter of the
marriage contract.</p>
<p>You remember I told you that Sir George had sent Lady Crawford
as an advance guard to place the parchment in the enemy's hands.
But the advance guard feared the enemy and therefore did not
deliver the contract directly to Dorothy. She placed it
conspicuously upon the table, knowing well that her niece's
curiosity would soon prompt an examination.</p>
<p><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>I was sitting before the
fire in Aunt Dorothy's room, talking to Madge when Lady Crawford
entered, placed the parchment on the table, and took a chair by my
side. Soon Dorothy entered the room. The roll of parchment, brave
with ribbons, was lying on the table. It attracted her attention at
once, and she took it in her hands.</p>
<p>"What is this?" she asked carelessly. Her action was prompted
entirely by idle curiosity. That, by the way, was no small motive
with Dorothy. She had the curiosity of a young doe. Receiving no
answer, she untied the ribbons and unrolled the parchment to
investigate its contents for herself. When the parchment was
unrolled, she began to read:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In the name of God, amen. This indenture of agreement, looking
to union in the holy bonds of marriage between the Right Honorable
Lord James Stanley of the first part, and Mistress Dorothy Vernon
of Haddon of the second part&mdash;"</p>
<p>She read no farther. She crumpled the beautiful parchment in her
hands, walked over to the fire, and quietly placed the sacred
instrument in the midst of the flames. Then she turned away with a
sneer of contempt upon her face and&mdash;again I grieve to tell
you this&mdash;said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In the name of God, amen. May this indenture be damned."</p>
<p>"Dorothy!" exclaimed Lady Crawford, horrified at her niece's
profanity. "I feel shame for your impious words."</p>
<p>"I don't care what you feel, aunt," retorted Dorothy, with a
dangerous glint in her eyes. "Feel as you wish, I meant what I
said, and I will say it again if you would like to hear it. I will
say it to father when I see him. Now, Aunt Dorothy, I love you and
I love my father, but I give you fair warning there is trouble
ahead for any one who crosses me in this matter."</p>
<p>She certainly looked as if she spoke the truth. Then <a name=
"Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>she hummed a tune under her
breath&mdash;a dangerous signal in Dorothy at certain times. Soon
the humming turned to whistling. Whistling in those olden days was
looked upon as a species of crime in a girl.</p>
<p>Dorothy stood by the window for a short time and then taking up
an embroidery frame, drew a chair nearer to the light and began to
work at her embroidery. In a moment or two she stopped whistling,
and we could almost feel the silence in the room. Madge, of course,
only partly knew what had happened, and her face wore an expression
of expectant, anxious inquiry. Aunt Dorothy looked at me, and I
looked at the fire. The parchment burned slowly. Lady Crawford,
from a sense of duty to Sir George and perhaps from politic
reasons, made two or three attempts to speak, and after five
minutes of painful silence she brought herself to say:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Dorothy, your father left the contract here for you to read. He
will be angry when he learns what you have done. Such disobedience
is sure to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not another word from you," screamed Dorothy, springing like a
tigress from her chair. "Not another word from you or I
will&mdash;I will scratch you. I will kill some one. Don't speak to
me. Can't you see that I am trying to calm myself for an interview
with father? An angry brain is full of blunders. I want to make
none. I will settle this affair with father. No one else, not even
you, Aunt Dorothy, shall interfere." The girl turned to the window,
stood beating a tattoo upon the glass for a moment or two, then
went over to Lady Crawford and knelt by her side. She put her arms
about Aunt Dorothy's neck, softly kissed her, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Forgive me, dear aunt; forgive me. I am almost crazed with my
troubles. I love you dearly indeed, indeed I do."</p>
<p>Madge gropingly went to Dorothy's side and took her hand.
Dorothy kissed Madge's hand and rose to her feet.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>Where is my father?" asked
Dorothy, to whom a repentant feeling toward Lady Crawford had
brought partial calmness. "I will go to him immediately and will
have this matter over. We might as well understand each other at
once. Father seems very dull at understanding me. But he shall know
me better before long."</p>
<p>Sir George may have respected the strength of his adversary, but
Dorothy had no respect for the strength of her foe. She was eager
for the fray. When she had a disagreeable thing to do, she always
wanted to do it quickly.</p>
<p>Dorothy was saved the trouble of seeking her father, for at that
moment he entered the room.</p>
<p>"You are welcome, father," said Dorothy in cold, defiant tones.
"You have come just in time to see the last flickering flame of
your fine marriage contract." She led him to the fireplace. "Does
it not make a beautiful smoke and blaze?"</p>
<p>"Did you dare&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Ay, that I did," replied Dorothy.</p>
<p>"You dared?" again asked her father, unable to believe the
evidence of his eyes.</p>
<p>"Ay, so I said; that I did," again said Dorothy.</p>
<p>"By the death of Christ&mdash;" began Sir George.</p>
<p>"Now be careful, father, about your oaths," the girl
interrupted. "You must not forget the last batch you made and
broke."</p>
<p>Dorothy's words and manner maddened Sir George. The expression
of her whole person, from her feet to her hair, breathed defiance.
The poise of her body and of her limbs, the wild glint in her eyes,
and the turn of her head, all told eloquently that Sir George had
no chance to win and that Dorothy was an unconquerable foe. It is a
wonder he did not learn in that one moment that he could never
bring his daughter to marry Lord Stanley.</p>
<p>"I will imprison you," cried Sir George, gasping with rage.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>Very well," responded
Dorothy, smilingly. "You kept me prisoner for a fortnight. I did
not ask you to liberate me. I am ready to go back to my
apartments."</p>
<p>"But now you shall go to the dungeon," her father said.</p>
<p>"Ah, the dungeon!" cried the girl, as if she were delighted at
the thought. "The dungeon! Very well, again. I am ready to go to
the dungeon. You may keep me there the remainder of my natural
life. I cannot prevent you from doing that, but you cannot force me
to marry Lord Stanley."</p>
<p>"I will starve you until you obey me!" retorted her father. "I
will starve you!"</p>
<p>"That, again, you may easily do, my dear father; but again I
tell you I will never marry Stanley. If you think I fear to die,
try to kill me. I do not fear death. You have it not in your power
to make me fear you or anything you can do. You may kill me, but I
thank God it requires my consent for my marriage to Stanley, and I
swear before God that never shall be given."</p>
<p>The girl's terrible will and calm determination staggered Sir
George, and by its force beat down even his strong will. The
infuriated old man wavered a moment and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Fool, I seek only your happiness in this marriage. Only your
happiness. Why will you not consent to it?"</p>
<p>I thought the battle was over, and that Dorothy was the victor.
She thought so, too, but was not great enough to bear her triumph
silently. She kept on talking and carried her attack too far.</p>
<p>"And I refuse to obey because of my happiness. I refuse because
I hate Lord Stanley, and because, as you already know, I love
another man."</p>
<p>When she spoke the words "because I love another man," the cold,
defiant expression of her face changed to one of ecstasy.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>I will have you to the
dungeon this very hour, you brazen huzzy," cried Sir George.</p>
<p>"How often, father, shall I repeat that I am ready to go to the
dungeon? I am eager to obey you in all things save one."</p>
<p>"You shall have your wish," returned Sir George. "Would that you
had died ere you had disgraced your house with a low-bred dog whose
name you are ashamed to utter."</p>
<p>"Father, there has been no disgrace," Dorothy answered, and her
words bore the ring of truth.</p>
<p>"You have been meeting the fellow at secluded spots in the
forest&mdash;how frequently you have met him God only
knows&mdash;and you lied to me when you were discovered at Bowling
Green Gate."</p>
<p>"I would do it again gladly if I but had the chance," answered
the girl, who by that time was reckless of consequences.</p>
<p>"But the chance you shall not have," retorted Sir George.</p>
<p>"Do not be too sure, father," replied Dorothy. She was unable to
resist the temptation to mystify him. "I may see him before another
hour. I will lay you this wager, father, if I do not within one
hour see the man&mdash;the man whom I love&mdash;I will marry Lord
Stanley. If I see him within that time you shall permit me to marry
him. I have seen him two score times since the day you surprised me
at the gate."</p>
<p>That was a dangerous admission for the girl to make, and she
soon regretted it with all her heart. Truly she was right. An angry
brain is full of blunders.</p>
<p>Of course Dorothy's words, which were so full of meaning to
Madge and me, meant little to Sir George. He looked upon them only
as irritating insolence on her part. A few minutes later, however,
they became full of significance.</p>
<p><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>Sir George seemed to have
forgotten the Stanley marriage and the burning of the contract in
his quarrel with Dorothy over her unknown lover.</p>
<p>Conceive, if you can, the situation in Haddon Hall at that time.
There was love-drunk Dorothy, proud of the skill which had enabled
her to outwit her wrathful father. There was Sir George, whose
mental condition, inflamed by constant drinking, bordered on frenzy
because he felt that his child, whom he had so tenderly loved from
the day of her birth, had disgraced herself with a low-born wretch
whom she refused to name. And there, under the same roof, lived the
man who was the root and source of all the trouble. A pretty kettle
of fish!</p>
<p>"The wager, father, will you take it?" eagerly asked
Dorothy.</p>
<p>Sir George, who thought that her words were spoken only to anger
him, waved her off with his hands and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I have reason to believe that I know the wretch for whose sake
you have disgraced yourself. You may be sure that I shall soon know
him with certainty. When I do, I will quickly have him in my power.
Then I will hang him to a tree on Bowling Green, and you shall see
the low-born dog die."</p>
<p>"He is better born than any of our house," retorted Dorothy, who
had lost all sense of caution. "Ay, he is better born than any with
whom we claim kin."</p>
<p>Sir George stood in open-eyed wonder, and Dorothy continued:
"You cannot keep him from me. I shall see him, and I will have him
despite you. I tell you again, I have seen him two score times
since you tried to spy upon us at Bowling Green Gate, and I will
see him whenever I choose, and I will wed him when I am ready to do
so. You cannot prevent it. You can only be forsworn, oath upon
oath; and if I were you, I would stop swearing."</p>
<p><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>Sir George, as was usual
with him in those sad times, was inflamed with drink, and Dorothy's
conduct, I must admit, was maddening. In the midst of her taunting
Thomas stepped into the room bearing an armful of fagots. Sir
George turned to him and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Go and tell Welch to bring a set of manacles."</p>
<p>"For Mistress Dorothy?" Thomas asked, surprised into the
exclamation.</p>
<p>"Curse you, do you mean to bandy words with me, you scum?" cried
Sir George.</p>
<p>He snatched a fagot from John and drew back his arm to strike
him. John took one step back from Sir George and one step nearer to
Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Yes, Thomas," said Dorothy, sneeringly, "bring Welch with the
manacles for me. My dear father would put me in the dungeon out of
the reach of other men, so that he may keep me safely for my
unknown lover. Go, Thomas. Go, else father will again be forsworn
before Christ and upon his knighthood."</p>
<p>"This before a servant! I'll gag you, you hellish vixen," cried
Sir George. Then I am sure he knew not what he did. "Curse you!" he
cried, as he held the fagot upraised and rushed upon Dorothy. John,
with his arms full of fagots, could not avert the blow which
certainly would have killed the girl, but he could take it. He
sprang between Dorothy and her father, the fagot fell upon his
head, and he sank to the floor. In his fall John's wig dropped off,
and when the blood began to flow from the wound Dorothy kneeled
beside his prostrate form. She snatched the great bush of false
beard from his face and fell to kissing his lips and his hands in a
paroxysm of passionate love and grief. Her kisses she knew to be a
panacea for all ills John could be heir to, and she thought they
would heal even the wound her father had given, and stop the
frightful outpouring of John's <a name="Page_254" id=
"Page_254"></a>life-blood. The poor girl, oblivious of all save her
wounded lover, murmured piteously:&mdash;</p>
<p>"John, John, speak to me; 'tis Dorothy." She placed her lips
near his ear and whispered: "'Tis Dorothy, John. Speak to her." But
she received no response. Then came a wild light to her eyes and
she cried aloud: "John, 'tis Dorothy. Open your eyes. Speak to me,
John! oh, for God's sake speak to me! Give some little sign that
you live," but John was silent. "My God, my God! Help, help! Will
no one help me save this man? See you not that his life is flowing
away? This agony will kill me. John, my lover, my lord, speak to
me. Ah, his heart, his heart! I will know." She tore from his
breast the leathern doublet and placed her ear over his heart.
"Thank God, it beats!" she cried in a frenzied whisper, as she
kissed his breast and turned her ear again to hear his heart's
welcome throbbing. Then she tried to lift him in her arms and
succeeded in placing his head in her lap. It was a piteous scene.
God save me from witnessing another like it.</p>
<p>After Dorothy lifted John's head to her lap he began to breathe
perceptibly, and the girl's agitation passed away as she gently
stroked his hair and kissed him over and over again, softly
whispering her love to his unresponsive ear in a gentle frenzy of
ineffable tenderness such as was never before seen in this world, I
do believe. I wish with all my heart that I were a maker of
pictures so that I might draw for you the scene which is as clear
and vivid in every detail to my eyes now as it was upon that awful
day in Haddon Hall. There lay John upon the floor and by his side
knelt Dorothy. His head was resting in her lap. Over them stood Sir
George with the murderous fagot raised, as if he intended again to
strike. I had sprung to his side and was standing by him, intending
to fell him to the floor should he attempt to repeat the blow
<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>upon either Dorothy or John.
Across from Sir George and me, that is, upon the opposite side of
Dorothy and John, stood Lady Crawford and Madge, who clung to each
other in terror. The silence was heavy, save when broken by
Dorothy's sobs and whispered ejaculations to John. Sir George's
terrible deed had deprived all of us, including himself, of the
power to speak. I feared to move from his side lest he should
strike again. After a long agony of silence he angrily threw the
fagot away from him and asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Who is this fellow? Can any one tell me?"</p>
<p>Only Madge, Dorothy, and I could have given him true answer. By
some strange power of divination Madge had learned all that had
happened, and she knew as well as I the name of the man who lay
upon the floor battling with death. Neither Madge nor I
answered.</p>
<p>"Who is this fellow?" again demanded Sir George.</p>
<p>Dorothy lifted her face toward her father.</p>
<p>"He is the man whom you seek, father," she answered, in a low,
tearful voice. "He is my lover; he is my life; he is my soul, and
if you have murdered him in your attempt to kill your own child,
all England shall hear of it and you shall hang. He is worth more
in the eyes of the queen than we and all our kindred. You know not
whom you have killed."</p>
<p>Sir George's act had sobered him.</p>
<p>"I did not intend to kill him&mdash;in that manner," said Sir
George, dropping his words absent-mindedly. "I hoped to hang him.
Where is Dawson? Some one fetch Dawson."</p>
<p>Several of the servants had gathered about the open door in the
next room, and in obedience to Sir George's command one of them
went to seek the forester. I feared that John would die from the
effects of the blow; but I also knew from experience that a man's
head may receive very hard knocks and life still remain. Should
John re<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>cover and should Sir
George learn his name, I was sure that my violent cousin would
again attempt the personal administration of justice and would hang
him, under the old Saxon law. In that event Parliament would not be
so easily pacified as upon the occasion of the former hanging at
Haddon; and I knew that if John should die by my cousin's hand, Sir
George would pay for the act with his life and his estates. Fearing
that Sir George might learn through Dawson of John's identity, I
started out in search of Will to have a word with him before he
could see his master. I felt sure that for many reasons Will would
be inclined to save John; but to what extent his fidelity to the
cause of his master might counteract his resentment of Sir George's
act, I did not know. I suspected that Dawson was privy to John's
presence in Haddon Hall, but I was not sure of it, so I wished to
prepare the forester for his interview with Sir George and to give
him a hint of my plans for securing John's safety, in the event he
should not die in Aunt Dorothy's room.</p>
<p>When I opened the door in the Northwest Tower I saw Dawson
coming toward the Hall from the dove-cote, and I hastened forward
to meet him. It was pitiful that so good a man as Sir George Vernon
was, should have been surrounded in his own house by real friends
who were also traitors. That was the condition of affairs in Haddon
Hall, and I felt that I was the chief offender. The evil, however,
was all of Sir George's making. Tyranny is the father of
treason.</p>
<p>When I met Dawson I said: "Will, do you know who Tom-Tom
is?"</p>
<p>The forester hesitated for a moment, and said, "Well, Sir
Malcolm, I suppose he is Thomas&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no, Will, tell me the truth. Do you know that he
is&mdash;or perhaps by this time I should say he was&mdash;Sir John
Manners?"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>Was?" cried Will. "Great
God! Has Sir George discovered&mdash;is he dead? If he is dead, it
will be a sad day for Sir George and for Haddon Hall. Tell me
quickly."</p>
<p>I at once knew Will Dawson was in the secret. I
answered:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I hope he is not dead. Sir George attempted to strike Dorothy
with a fagot, but Thomas stepped in front of her and received the
blow. He is lying almost, if not quite, dead in Lady Crawford's
room. Sir George knows nothing about him, save that he is Dorothy's
lover. But should Thomas revive I feel sure my cousin will hang him
in the morning unless steps are taken to prevent the deed."</p>
<p>"Sir Malcolm, if you will stand by me," said Dawson, "Sir George
will not hang him."</p>
<p>"I certainly will stand by you, Dawson. Have no doubt on that
score. Sir George intends to cast John into the dungeon, and should
he do so I want you to send Jennie Faxton to Rutland and have her
tell the Rutlanders to rescue John to-night. To-morrow morning I
fear will be too late. Be on your guard, Will. Do not allow Sir
George to discover that you have any feeling in this matter. Above
all, lead him from the possibility of learning that Thomas is Sir
John Manners. I will contrive to admit the Rutland men at
midnight."</p>
<p>I hastened with Dawson back to the Hall, where we found the
situation as I had left it. John's head was lying on Dorothy's lap,
and she was trying to dress his wound with pieces of linen torn
from her clothing. Sir George was pacing to and fro across the
room, breaking forth at times in curses against Dorothy because of
her relations with a servant.</p>
<p>When Dawson and I entered the room, Sir George spoke angrily to
Will:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Who is this fellow? You employed him. Who is he?"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>He gave me his name as
Thomas Thompson," returned Will, "and he brought me a favorable
letter of recommendation from Danford."</p>
<p>Danford was forester to the Duke of Devonshire, and lived at
Chatsworth.</p>
<p>"There was naught in the letter save that he was a good servant
and an honest man. That is all we can ask of any man."</p>
<p>"But who is he?" again demanded Sir George.</p>
<p>"Your worship may perhaps learn from Danford more than I can
tell you," replied the forester, adroitly avoiding a lie.</p>
<p>"Think of it, Malcolm," said Sir George, speaking to me. "Think
of it. My daughter, my only child, seeks for her husband this
low-born serving man. I have always been sure that the fellow would
prove to be such." Then he turned to Dawson: "Throw the fellow into
the dungeon. If he lives till morning, I will have him hanged. To
the dungeon with him."</p>
<p>Sir George waved his hand toward Dawson and Tom Welch, and then
stepped aside. Will made an effort to hide his feelings, and
without a word or gesture that could betray him, he and Welch
lifted John to carry him away. Then it was piteous to see Dorothy.
She clung to John and begged that he might be left with her. Sir
George violently thrust her away from John's side, but she, still
upon her knees, grasped her father's hand and cried out in
agony:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Father, let me remain with him. If you have ever felt love for
me, and if my love for you has ever touched one tender spot in your
heart, pity me now and leave this man with me, or let me go with
him. I beg you, father; I plead; I implore. He may be dying. We
know not. In this hour of my agony be merciful to me."</p>
<p>But Sir George rudely repulsed her and left the room, <a name=
"Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>following Welch and Dawson, who bore
John's unconscious form between them. Dorothy rose to her feet
screaming and tried to follow John. I, fearing that in her frenzy
of grief she might divulge John's name, caught her in my arms and
detained her by force. She turned upon me savagely and struck me in
her effort to escape. She called me traitor, villain, dog, but I
lifted her in my arms and carried her struggling to her bedroom. I
wanted to tell her of the plans which Dawson and I had made, but I
feared to do so, lest she might in some way betray them, so I left
her in the room with Lady Crawford and Madge. I told Lady Crawford
to detain Dorothy at all hazards, and I whispered to Madge asking
her to tell Dorothy that I would look to John's comfort and safety.
I then hastily followed Sir George, Dawson, and Welch, and in a few
moments I saw them leave John, bleeding and senseless, upon the
dungeon floor. When Sir George's back was turned, Dawson by my
orders brought the surgeon from the stable where he had been
working with the horses. The surgeon bound up the wound in John's
head and told me, to my great joy, that it was not fatal. Then he
administered a reviving potion and soon consciousness returned. I
whispered to John that Dawson and I would not forsake him, and,
fearing discovery by Sir George, hurriedly left the dungeon.</p>
<p>I believe there is a certain amount of grief and sorrow which
comes with every great joy to give it a cost mark whereby we may
always know its value. The love between Dorothy and John indeed was
marked in plain figures of high denominations.</p>

<h2>THE LEICESTER POSSIBILITY</h2>
<p>On Leaving the dungeon I sought Madge, and after I had whispered
a word to her from my heart I asked her to tell Dorothy the
encouraging words of the surgeon, and also to tell her that she
should not be angry with me until she was sure she had good cause.
I dared not send a more explicit message, and I dared not go to
Dorothy, for Sir George was in a suspicious mood and I feared ruin
not only for myself but for John, should my violent cousin suspect
me of sympathy with his daughter and her lover.</p>
<p>I also sought Aunt Dorothy and whispered a word to her of which
you shall hear more presently.</p>
<p>"Ah, I cannot do it," cried the trembling old lady in response
to my whispered request. "I cannot do it."</p>
<p>"But you must, Aunt Dorothy," I responded. "Upon it depend three
lives: Sir George's, Dorothy's, and her lover's. You must do
it."</p>
<p>"I will try," she replied.</p>
<p>"That assurance will not suit me," I responded. "You must
promise upon your salvation that you will not fail me."</p>
<p>"I promise upon my salvation," replied Aunt Dorothy.</p>
<p>That evening of course we did not see the ladies at supper. Sir
George and I ate in silence until my cousin became talkative from
drink. Then he spoke bitterly of Dorothy's conduct, and bore with
emphasis upon the fact <a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>that
the lover to whom Dorothy had stooped was a low-born serving
man.</p>
<p>"But Dorothy declares he is noble," I responded.</p>
<p>"She has lied to me so often that I do not believe a word she
says," returned Sir George.</p>
<p>He swore oath upon oath that the wretch should hang in the
morning, and for the purpose of carrying into effect his intention
he called in Joe the butcher and told him to make all things ready
for the execution.</p>
<p>I did not attempt to thwart his purpose by word or gesture,
knowing it would be useless, but hoped that John would be out of
his reach long ere the cock would crow his first greeting to the
morrow's sun.</p>
<p>After Sir George had drunk far into the night the servants
helped him to bed, and he carried with him the key to the dungeon
together with the keys to all the outer doors and gates of Haddon
Hall, as was his custom. The keys were in a bunch, held together by
an iron ring, and Sir George always kept them under his pillow at
night.</p>
<p>I sought my bed in Eagle Tower and lay down in my clothes to
rest and wait. The window of my room was open.</p>
<p>Within an hour after midnight I heard the hooting of an owl. The
doleful sound came up to me from the direction of the stone
footbridge at the southwest corner of the Hall below the chapel. I
went to my window and looked out over the courts and terrace.
Haddon Hall and all things in and about it were wrapped in
slumbrous silence. I waited, and again I heard the hooting of the
owl. Noiselessly leaving my room I descended the stone steps to an
unused apartment in the tower from which a window opened upon the
roof of the north wing of the Hall. Along that roof I crept with
bared feet, till I reached another roof, the battlements of which
at the lowest point were not more than twenty feet from the ground.
Thence I clambered down to a window cornice five or six feet
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>lower, and jumped, at the risk
of my limbs, the remaining distance of fifteen or sixteen feet to
the soft sod beneath. I ran with all haste, took my stand under
Aunt Dorothy's window, and whistled softly. The window casing
opened and I heard the great bunch of keys jingling and clinking
against the stone wall as Aunt Dorothy paid them out to me by means
of a cord. After I had secured the keys I called in a whisper to
Lady Crawford and directed her to leave the cord hanging from the
window. I also told her to remain in readiness to draw up the keys
when they should have served their purpose. Then I took them and
ran to the stone footbridge where I found four Rutland men who had
come in response to the message Dawson had sent by Jennie Faxton.
Two of the men went with me, and we entered the lower garden by the
southwest postern. Thence we crept noiselessly to the terrace and
made our entrance into the Hall by "Dorothy's Postern." I had in my
life engaged in many questionable and dangerous enterprises, but
this was my first attempt at house-breaking. To say that I was
nervous would but poorly define the state of my feelings. Since
that day I have respected the high calling of burglary and regard
with favor the daring knights of the skeleton key. I was
frightened. I, who would feel no fear had I to fight a dozen men,
trembled with fright during this adventure. The deathlike silence
and the darkness in familiar places seemed uncanny to me. The very
chairs and tables appeared to be sleeping, and I was fearful lest
they should awaken. I cannot describe to you how I was affected.
Whether it was fear or awe or a smiting conscience I cannot say,
but my teeth chattered as if they were in the mouth of a fool, and
my knees quaked as if they supported a coward. Still I knew I was
doing my duty, though one's conscience sometimes smites him when
his reason tells him he is acting righteously. It is more
dan<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>gerous to possess a
sensitive conscience which cannot be made to hear reason than to
have none at all. But I will make short my account of that night's
doings. The two Rutland men and I groped our way to the dungeon and
carried forth John, who was weak from loss of blood. I told them to
lock the door of the Hall as they passed out and to attach the keys
to the cord hanging from Lady Crawford's window. Then I climbed to
my room again, feeling in conscience like a criminal because I had
done the best act of my life.</p>
<p>Early next morning I was awakened by a great noise in the upper
court. When I looked out at my window I beheld Sir George. He was
half dressed and was angrily questioning the servants and
retainers. I knew that he had discovered John's escape, but I did
not know all, nor did I know the worst. I dressed and went to the
kitchen, where I bathed my hands and face. There I learned that the
keys to the hall had been stolen from under Sir George's pillow,
and that the prisoner had escaped from the dungeon. Old Bess, the
cook, nodded her head wisely and whispered to me the words, "Good
for Mistress Doll."</p>
<p>Bess's unsought confidence alarmed me. I did not relish the
thought that Bess nor any one else should believe me to be in
sympathy with Dorothy, and I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If Mistress Vernon had aught to do with last night's affairs,
she should be full of shame. I will not believe that she knew of it
at all. My opinion is that one of the servants was bribed by some
person interested in Tom-Tom's escape."</p>
<p>"Believe nothing of the sort," retorted Bess. "It is the
mistress and not the servant who stole the keys and liberated
Tom-Tom. But the question is, who may Tom-Tom be? and the servants'
hall is full of it. We are not uncertain as to the manner of his
escape. Some of the servants do say that the Earl of Leicester be
now visiting the Duke <a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>of
Devonshire; and some also do say that his Lordship be fond of
disguises in his gallantry. They do also say that the queen is in
love with him, and that he must disguise himself when he woos
elsewhere, or she be's famously jealous. It would be a pretty mess
the master has brought us all into should Tom-Tom prove to be my
lord Earl of Leicester. We'd all hang and to hell."</p>
<p>"Bess, that tongue of yours will cost you your head one of these
good times," I remarked, while I rubbed my face with the towel.</p>
<p>"I would sooner lose my head," retorted Bess, "than have my
mouth shut by fear. I know, Sir Malcolm, that I'll not die till my
time comes; but please the good God when my time does come I will
try to die talking."</p>
<p>"That you will," said I.</p>
<p>"True word, Sir Malcolm," she answered, and I left her in
possession of the field.</p>
<p>I went into the courtyard, and when Sir George saw me he said,
"Malcolm, come with me to my room; I want a word with you."</p>
<p>We went to his room.</p>
<p>"I suppose you know of the fellow's escape last night?" he
said.</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied, "Bess told me about it in the kitchen."</p>
<p>It seemed to me that my words said, "I did it."</p>
<p>"Not only was the fellow liberated," said my cousin, "but the
keys to all the outer gates and doors of the Hall have been stolen
and carried away. Can you help me unravel this affair?"</p>
<p>"Do you suspect any one of having stolen the keys?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I know, of course, that Dorothy did it. Who her accomplices
were, if any she had, I do not know. I have catechized the
servants, but the question is bottomless to me."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>Have you spoken to Dorothy
on the subject?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No," he replied, "but I have sent word to her by the Faxton
girl that I am going to see her at once. Come with me."</p>
<p>We went into Lady Crawford's room. She was ill and in bed. I did
not wonder that she was ill after the experiences of the previous
night. Sir George asked her if she had heard or seen Dorothy pass
through her room during the night. She said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Dorothy did not pass through this room last night. I did not
once close my eyes in sleep, and I should have seen her had she
been here at all."</p>
<p>Sir George entered Dorothy's bedroom, and Lady Crawford beckoned
me to go to her side.</p>
<p>"I waited till sunrise," she said, "that I might draw up the
keys."</p>
<p>"Hush!" said I, "the cord?"</p>
<p>"I burned it," she replied.</p>
<p>Then I followed Sir George into Dorothy's room. Madge was
dressed for the day, and Dorothy, who had been helping her, was
making her own toilet. Her hair hung loose and fell like a cataract
of sunshine over her bare shoulders. But no words that I can write
would give you a conception of her wondrous beauty, and I shall not
waste them in the attempt. When we entered the room she was
standing at the mirror. She turned, comb in hand, toward Sir George
and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I suppose, father, you will accuse me of liberating
Thomas."</p>
<p>"You must know that I will accuse you," replied Sir George.</p>
<p>"Then, father, for once you will accuse me falsely. I am
overjoyed that he has escaped, and I certainly should have tried to
liberate him had I thought it possible to do so.<a name="Page_266"
id="Page_266"></a> But I did not do it, though to tell you the
truth I am sorry I did not."</p>
<p>"I do not believe you," her father replied.</p>
<p>"I knew you would not believe me," answered Dorothy. "Had I
liberated him I should probably have lied to you about it;
therefore, I wonder not that you should disbelieve me. But I tell
you again upon my salvation that I know nothing of the stealing of
the keys nor of Tom-Tom's escape. Believe me or not, I shall deny
it no more."</p>
<p>Madge gropingly went to Sir George's side, and he tenderly put
his arms about her, saying:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I would that you were my daughter." Madge took his hand
caressingly.</p>
<p>"Uncle, I want to tell you that Dorothy speaks the truth," she
said. "I have been with her every moment since the terrible scene
of yesterday evening. Neither Dorothy nor I closed our eyes in
sleep all night long. She lay through the dark hours moaning, and I
tried to comfort her. Our door was locked, and it was opened only
by your messenger who brought the good news of Tom-Tom's escape. I
say good news, uncle, because his escape has saved you from the
stain of murder. You are too brave a man to do murder, uncle."</p>
<p>"How dare you," said Sir George, taking his arm from Madge's
waist, "how dare you defend&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Now, uncle, I beg you pause and take a moment's thought," said
Madge, interrupting him. "You have never spoken unkindly to
me."</p>
<p>"Nor will I, Madge, so long as I live. I know there is not a lie
in you, and I am sure you believe to be true all you tell me, but
Dorothy has deceived you by some adroit trick."</p>
<p>"If she deceived me, she is a witch," retorted Madge, laughing
softly.</p>
<p>"That I am almost ready to believe is the case," said
Sir<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a> George. Dorothy, who was
combing her hair at the mirror, laughed softly and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My broomstick is under the bed, father."</p>
<p>Sir George went into Lady Crawford's room and shut the door,
leaving me with the girls.</p>
<p>When her father had left, Dorothy turned upon me with fire in
her eyes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Malcolm Vernon, if you ever lay hands upon me again as you did
last night, I will&mdash;I will scratch you. You pretended to be
his friend and mine, but for a cowardly fear of my father you came
between us and you carried me to this room by force. Then you
locked the door and&mdash;and"&mdash;</p>
<p>"Did not Madge give you my message?" I asked, interrupting
her.</p>
<p>"Yes, but did you not force me away from him when, through my
fault, he was almost at death's door?"</p>
<p>"Have your own way, Dorothy," I said. "There lives not, I hope,
another woman in the world so unreasoning and perverse as you."</p>
<p>She tossed her head contemptuously and continued to comb her
hair.</p>
<p>"How, suppose you," I asked, addressing Dorothy's back, as if I
were seeking information, "how, suppose you, the Rutland people
learned that John was confined in the Haddon dungeon, and how did
they come by the keys?"</p>
<p>The girl turned for a moment, and a light came to her
anger-clouded face as the rainbow steals across the blackened
sky.</p>
<p>"Malcolm, Malcolm," she cried, and she ran to me with her bare
arms outstretched.</p>
<p>"Did you liberate him?" she asked. "How did you get the
keys?"</p>
<p>"I know nothing of it, Dorothy, nothing," I replied.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>Swear it, Malcolm, swear
it," she said.</p>
<p>"I will swear to nothing," I said, unclasping her arms from my
neck.</p>
<p>"Then I will kiss you," she answered, "for you are my dear good
brother, and never so long as I live will I again doubt you."</p>
<p>But she did before long doubt me again, and with good cause.</p>
<p>Dorothy being in a gentle humor; I took advantage of the
opportunity to warn her against betraying John's name to her
father. I also told her to ask her father's forgiveness, and
advised her to feign consent to the Stanley marriage. Matters had
reached a point where some remedy, however desperate, must be
applied.</p>
<p>Many persons, I fear, will condemn me for advising Dorothy to
deceive her father; but what would you have had me do? Should I
have told her to marry Stanley? Certainly not. Had I done so, my
advice would have availed nothing. Should I have advised her to
antagonize her father, thereby keeping alive his wrath, bringing
trouble to herself and bitter regret to him? Certainly not. The
only course left for me to advise was the least of three
evils&mdash;a lie. Three evils must be very great indeed when a lie
is the least of them. In the vast army of evils with which this
world swarms the lie usually occupies a proud position in the front
rank. But at times conditions arise when, coward-like, he slinks to
the rear and evils greater than he take precedence. In such sad
case I found Dorothy, and I sought help from my old enemy, the lie.
Dorothy agreed with me and consented to do all in her power to
deceive her father, and what she could not do to that end was not
worth doing.</p>
<p>Dorothy was anxious about John's condition, and sent Jennie
Faxton to Bowling Green, hoping a letter would be there for her.
Jennie soon returned with a letter, and <a name="Page_269" id=
"Page_269"></a>Dorothy once more was full of song, for John's
letter told her that he was fairly well and that he would by some
means see her soon again despite all opposition.</p>
<p>"At our next meeting, my fair mistress," John said in the
letter, "you must be ready to come with me. I will wait no longer
for you. In fairness to me and to yourself you shall not ask me to
wait. I will accept no more excuses. You must come with me when
next we meet."</p>
<p>"Ah, well," said Dorothy to Madge, "if I must go with him, I
must. Why did he not talk in that fashion when we rode out together
the last time? I like to be made to do what I want to do. He was
foolish not to make me consent, or better still would it have been
had he taken the reins of my horse and ridden off with me, with or
against my will. I might have screamed, and I might have fought
him, but I could not have hurt him, and he would have had his way,
and&mdash;and," with a sigh, "I should have had my way."</p>
<p>After a brief pause devoted to thought, she
continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If I were a man and were wooing a woman, I would first learn
what she wanted to do and then&mdash;and then, by my word, I would
make her do it."</p>
<p>I went from Dorothy's room to breakfast, where I found Sir
George. I took my seat at the table and he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Who, in God's name, suppose you, could have taken the keys from
my pillow?"</p>
<p>"Is there any one whom you suspect?" I asked for lack of
anything else to say.</p>
<p>"I at first thought, of course, that Dorothy had taken them," he
answered. "But Madge would not lie, neither would my sister.
Dorothy would not hesitate to lie herself blue in the face, but for
some reason I believed her when she told me she knew nothing of the
affair. Her words sounded like truth for once."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>I think, Sir George," said
I, "you should have left off 'for once.' Dorothy is not a liar. She
has spoken falsely to you only because she fears you. I am sure
that a lie is hateful to her."</p>
<p>"Malcolm, I wish I could have your faith," he responded. "By the
way, Malcolm, have you ever seen the Earl of Leicester?"</p>
<p>"I saw him only once. He visited Scotland during the ceremonies
at Queen Mary's return from France. I saw him once, and then but
briefly. Why do you ask?"</p>
<p>"It is whispered among the servants," said Sir George, "that
Leicester is at Chatsworth in disguise."</p>
<p>Chatsworth was the home of the Duke of Devonshire, and was but a
short distance from Haddon. After Sir George spoke, I remembered
the words of old Bess.</p>
<p>"Still, I do not know why you ask." I said.</p>
<p>"My reason is this," replied Sir George; "Dorothy declared the
fellow was of noble blood. It is said that Leicester loves gallant
adventure incognito. He fears her Majesty's jealousy if in such
matters he acts openly. You remember the sad case of Mistress
Robsart. I wonder what became of the girl? He made way with her in
some murderous fashion, I am sure." Sir George remained in revery
for a moment, and then the poor old man cried in tones of distress:
"Malcolm, if that fellow whom I struck last night was Leicester,
and if he has been trying his hellish tricks on my Doll I&mdash;I
should pity her; I should not abuse her. I may have been wrong. If
he has wronged Doll&mdash;if he has wronged my girl, I will pursue
him to the ends of the earth for vengeance. That is why I ask if
you have ever seen the Earl of Leicester. Was the man who lay upon
the floor last night Robert Dudley? If it were he, and if I had
known it, I would have beaten him to death then and there. Poor
Doll!"</p>
<p>Any one hearing the old man speak would easily have <a name=
"Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>known that Doll was all that life held
for him to love.</p>
<p>"I do not distinctly remember Leicester's face," I answered,
"but since you speak of it, I believe there is a resemblance
between him and the man we called Thomas. But even were it he, Sir
George, you need have no fear for Dorothy. She of all women is able
and willing to protect herself."</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="v271" id="v271"></a> <img src=
"images/v271.jpg" alt="" title="" /></div>
<p>"I will go to Dorothy and ask her to tell me the truth. Come
with me."</p>
<p>We again went to Dorothy's room. She had, since I last saw her,
received the letter from John of which I have spoken, and when we
entered her parlor where she and Madge were eating breakfast we
found her very happy. As a result she was willing and eager to act
upon my advice.</p>
<p>She rose and turned toward her father.</p>
<p>"You told me, Doll, that the fellow was of noble blood. Did you
speak the truth?"</p>
<p>"Yes, father, I spoke the truth. There is no nobler blood in
England than his, save that of our royal queen. In that you may
believe me, father, for I speak the truth."</p>
<p>Sir George remained silent for a moment and then
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If the man is he whom I believe him to be he can have no true
purpose with you. Tell me, my child&mdash;the truth will bring no
reproaches from me&mdash;tell me, has he misused you in any
way?"</p>
<p>"No, father, before God, he has been a true gentleman to
me."</p>
<p>The poor old man struggled for a moment with his emotions; then
tears came to his eyes and he covered his face with his hands as he
started to leave the room.</p>
<p>Dorothy ran to him and clasped her arms about his <a name=
"Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>neck. Those two, father and child,
were surely of one blood as shown in the storms of violence and
tenderness by which their natures were alternately swept.</p>
<p>"Father, you may believe me; you do believe me," said Dorothy.
"Furthermore, I tell you that this man has treated me with all
courtesy, nay, more: he has treated me with all the reverence he
would have shown our queen."</p>
<p>"He can have no true purpose with you, Doll," said Sir George,
who felt sure that Leicester was the man.</p>
<p>"But he has, father, a true purpose with me. He would make me
his wife to-day would I consent."</p>
<p>"Why then does he not seek you openly?"</p>
<p>"That he cannot do," Dorothy responded hesitatingly.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Doll, who is the man?" asked Sir George.</p>
<p>I was standing behind him and Dorothy's face was turned toward
me. She hesitated, and I knew by her expression that she was about
to tell all. Sir George, I believe, would have killed her had she
done so. I placed my finger on my lips and shook my head.</p>
<p>Dorothy said: "That I cannot tell you, father. You are wasting
words in asking me."</p>
<p>"Is it because of his wish that you refuse to tell me his name?"
asked Sir George. I nodded my head.</p>
<p>"Yes, father," softly responded Dorothy in the old dangerous,
dulcet tones.</p>
<p>"That is enough; I know who the man is."</p>
<p>Dorothy kissed her father. He returned the caress, much to my
surprise, and left the room.</p>
<p>When I turned to follow Sir George I glanced toward Dorothy. Her
eyes were like two moons, so full were they of wonderment and
inquiry.</p>
<p>I stopped with Sir George in his room. He was meditative and
sad.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>I believe my Doll has told
me the truth," he said.</p>
<p>"Have no doubt of it, Sir George," I replied.</p>
<p>"But what good intent can Leicester have toward my girl?" he
asked.</p>
<p>"Of that I cannot say," I replied; "but my dear cousin, of this
fact be sure: if he have evil intent toward Dorothy, he will
fail."</p>
<p>"But there was the Robsart girl," he replied.</p>
<p>"Ay," said I, "but Dorothy Vernon is not Amy Robsart. Have no
fear of your daughter. She is proof against both villany and craft.
Had she been in Mistress Robsart's place, Leicester would not have
deserted her. Dorothy is the sort of woman men do not desert. What
say you to the fact that Leicester might wish to make her his
wife?"</p>
<p>"He may purpose to do so secretly, as in the case of the Robsart
girl," returned Sir George. "Go, Malcolm, and ask her if he is
willing to make her his wife before the world."</p>
<p>I was glad of an opportunity for a word with Dorothy, so I
hastily went to her. I told her of the Leicester phase of the
situation, and I also told her that her father had asked me if the
man whom she loved was willing to make her his wife before the
world.</p>
<p>"Tell my father," said she, "that I will be no man's wife save
before all the world. A man who will not acknowledge me never shall
possess me."</p>
<p>I went back to Sir George and delivered the message word for
word.</p>
<p>"She is a strange, strong girl, isn't she, Malcolm?" said her
father.</p>
<p>"She is her father's child," I replied.</p>
<p>"By my spurs she is. She should have been a man," said Sir
George, with a twinkle of admiration in his eyes. He admired a good
fight even though he were beaten in it.</p>
<p><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>It is easy to be good when
we are happy. Dorothy, the great disturber, was both. Therefore,
peace reigned once more in Haddon Hall.</p>
<p>Letters frequently passed between John and Dorothy by the hand
of Jennie Faxton, but John made no attempt to meet his sweetheart.
He and Dorothy were biding their time.</p>
<p>A fortnight passed during which Cupid confined his operations to
Madge and myself. For her sweet sake he was gracious and strewed
our path with roses. I should delight to tell you of our wooing.
She a fair young creature of eighteen, I a palpitating youth of
thirty-five. I should love to tell you of Madge's promise to be my
wife, and of the announcement in the Hall of our betrothal; but
there was little of interest in it to any one save ourselves, and I
fear lest you should find it very sentimental and dull indeed. I
should love to tell you also of the delightful walks which Madge
and I took together along the sweet old Wye and upon the crest of
Bowling Green; but above all would I love to tell you of the
delicate rose tints that came to her cheek, and how most curiously
at times, when my sweetheart's health was bounding, the blessed
light of day would penetrate the darkened windows of her eyes, and
how upon such occasions she would cry out joyously, "Oh, Malcolm, I
can dimly see." I say I should love to tell you about all those
joyous happenings, but after all I fear I should shrink from doing
so in detail, for the feelings and sayings of our own hearts are
sacred to us. It is much easier to tell of the love affairs of
others.</p>
<p>A fortnight or three weeks passed quietly in Haddon Hall. Sir
George had the notion firmly fixed in his head that the man whom
Dorothy had been meeting held honorable intentions toward the girl.
He did her the justice to believe that by reason of her strength
and purity she would tolerate none other. At times he felt sure
that the <a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>man was Leicester,
and again he flouted the thought as impossible. If it were
Leicester, and if he wished to marry Dorothy, Sir George thought
the match certainly would be illustrious. Halting between the
questions, "Is he Leicester?" and "Is he not Leicester?" Sir George
did not press the Stanley nuptials, nor did he insist upon the
signing of the contract. Dorothy received from her father full
permission to go where and when she wished. But her father's
willingness to give her liberty excited her suspicions. She knew he
would permit her to leave the Hall only that he might watch her,
and, if possible, entrap her and John. Therefore, she rode out only
with Madge and me, and sought no opportunity to see her lover. It
may be that her passiveness was partly due to the fact that she
knew her next meeting with John would mean farewell to Haddon Hall.
She well knew she was void of resistance when in John's hands. And
his letter had told her frankly what he would expect from her when
next they should meet. She was eager to go to him; but the old
habit of love for home and its sweet associations and her returning
affection for her father, now that he was kind to her, were strong
cords entwining her tender heart, which she could not break
suddenly even for the sake of the greater joy.</p>
<p>One day Dorothy received from John a letter telling her he would
on the following morning start for the Scottish border with the
purpose of meeting the queen of Scotland. A plan had been formed
among Mary's friends in Scotland to rescue her from Lochleven
Castle, where she was a prisoner, and to bring her incognito to
Rutland. John had been chosen to escort her from the English border
to his father's castle. From thence, when the opportunity should
arise, she was to escape to France, or make her peace with
Elizabeth. The adventure was full of peril both for her Scottish
and English friends. The Scottish regent Murray <a name="Page_276"
id="Page_276"></a>surely would hang all the conspirators whom he
might capture, and Elizabeth would probably inflict summary
punishment upon any of her subjects whom she could convict of
complicity in the plot.</p>
<p>In connection with this scheme to rescue Mary it was said there
was also another conspiracy. There appeared to be a plot within a
plot which had for its end the enthronement of Mary in Elizabeth's
stead.</p>
<p>The Rutlands knew nothing of this subplot.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had once or twice expressed sympathy with her Scottish
cousin. She had said in John's presence that while she could not
for reasons of state <i>invite</i> Mary to seek refuge in England,
still if Mary would come uninvited she would be welcomed.
Therefore, John thought he was acting in accord with the English
queen's secret wish when he went to Rutland with the purpose of
being in readiness to meet Mary at the Scottish border.</p>
<p>There were two elements in Elizabeth's character on which John
had not counted. One was her royal prerogative to speak words she
did not mean; and the other was the universal feminine privilege to
change her mind. Our queen did not want Mary to visit England, nor
had she any knowledge of the plot to induce that event. She did,
however, fear that Mary's unwise friends among the Catholics
cherished the purpose of making Mary queen of England. Although
John had heard faint rumors of such a plot, he had been given to
understand that Mary had no share in it, and he believed that the
adventure in which he was about to embark had for its only purpose
her liberation from a cruel and unjust imprisonment. Her cause
appealed to John's chivalrous nature as it appealed to so many
other good though mistaken men who sought to give help to the
Scottish queen, and brought only grief to her and ruin to
themselves.</p>
<p>Dorothy had heard at various times just enough of these <a name=
"Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>plots to fill her heart with alarm
when she learned that John was about to be engaged in them. Her
trouble was twofold. She feared lest personal injury or death might
befall John; and jealousy, that shame of love, gnawed at her heart
despite her efforts to drive it away.</p>
<p>"Is she so marvellously beautiful?" Dorothy asked of me over and
over again, referring to Mary Stuart. "Is she such a marvel of
beauty and fascination that all men fall before her?"</p>
<p>"That usually is the result," I replied. "I have never known her
to smile upon a man who did not at once respond by falling upon his
knees to her."</p>
<p>My reply certainly was not comforting.</p>
<p>"Ah, then, I am lost," she responded, with a tremulous sigh.
"Is&mdash;is she prone to smile on men and&mdash;and&mdash;to grow
fond of them?"</p>
<p>"I should say, Dorothy, that both the smiling and the fondness
have become a habit with her."</p>
<p>"Then she will be sure to choose John from among all men. He is
so glorious and perfect and beautiful that she will be eager
to&mdash;to&mdash;O God! I wish he had not gone to fetch her."</p>
<p>"You need have no fear," I said reassuringly. "While Mary Stuart
is marvellously beautiful and fascinating, there is at least one
woman who excels her. Above all, that woman is pure and
chaste."</p>
<p>"Who is she, that one woman, Malcolm? Who is she?" asked the
girl, leaning forward in her chair and looking at me eagerly with
burning eyes.</p>
<p>"You are already a vain girl, Dorothy, and I shall not tell you
who that one woman is," I answered laughingly.</p>
<p>"No, no, Malcolm, I am not vain in this matter. It is of too
great moment to me for the petty vice of vanity to have any part in
it. You do not understand me. I care not for my beauty, save for
his sake. I long to be more <a name="Page_278" id=
"Page_278"></a>beautiful, more fascinating, and more attractive
than she&mdash;than any woman living&mdash;only because I long to
hold John&mdash;to keep him from her, from all others. I have seen
so little of the world that I must be sadly lacking in those arts
which please men, and I long to possess the beauty of the angels,
and the fascinations of Satan that I may hold John, hold him, hold
him, hold him. That I may hold him so sure and fast that it will be
impossible for him to break from me. At times, I almost wish he
were blind; then he could see no other woman. Ah, am I not a
wicked, selfish girl? But I will not allow myself to become
jealous. He is all mine, isn't he, Malcolm?" She spoke with nervous
energy, and tears were ready to spring from her eyes.</p>
<p>"He is all yours, Dorothy," I answered, "all yours, as surely as
that death will some day come to all of us. Promise me, Dorothy,
that you will never again allow a jealous thought to enter your
heart. You have no cause for jealousy, nor will you ever have. If
you permit that hateful passion to take possession of you, it will
bring ruin in its wake."</p>
<p>"It was, indeed, foolish in me," cried Dorothy, springing to her
feet and clasping her hands tightly; "and I promise never again to
feel jealousy. Malcolm, its faintest touch tears and gnaws at my
heart and racks me with agony. But I will drive it out of me. Under
its influence I am not responsible for my acts. It would quickly
turn me mad. I promise, oh, I swear, that I never will allow it to
come to me again."</p>
<p>Poor Dorothy's time of madness was not far distant nor was the
evil that was to follow in its wake.</p>
<p>John in writing to Dorothy concerning his journey to Scotland
had unhesitatingly intrusted to her keeping his honor, and,
unwittingly, his life. It did not once occur to him that she could,
under any conditions, betray him. I <a name="Page_279" id=
"Page_279"></a>trusted her as John did until I saw her vivid flash
of burning jealousy. But by the light of that flash I saw that
should the girl, with or without reason, become convinced that Mary
Stuart was her rival, she would quickly make Derbyshire the warmest
locality in Christendom, and John's life might pay the cost of her
folly. Dorothy would brook no rival&mdash;no, not for a single
hour. Should she become jealous she would at once be swept beyond
the influence of reason or the care for consequences. It were safer
to arouse a sleeping devil than Dorothy Vernon's jealousy. Now
about the time of John's journey to the Scottish border, two
matters of importance arose at Haddon Hall. One bore directly upon
Dorothy, namely, the renewal by the Stanleys of their suit for her
hand. The other was the announcement by the queen that she would
soon do Sir George Vernon the honor of spending a fortnight under
the roof of Haddon Hall. Each event was of great importance to the
King of the Peak. He had concluded that Thomas, the man-servant,
was not the Earl of Leicester in disguise, and when the Earl of
Derby again came forward with his marriage project, Sir George fell
back into his old hardness toward Dorothy, and she prepared her
armament, offensive and defensive, for instant use if need should
arise. I again began my machinations, since I can call my double
dealing by no other name. I induced Dorothy to agree to meet the
earl and his son James. Without promising positively to marry Lord
Stanley, she, at my suggestion, led her father to believe she was
ready to yield to his wishes. By this course she gained time and
liberty, and kept peace with her father. Since you have seen the
evils that war brought to Haddon, you well know how desirable peace
was. In time of war all Haddon was a field of carnage and unrest.
In time of peace the dear old Hall was an ideal home. I persuaded
Sir George not to insist on a positive promise from Dorothy,
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>and I advised him to allow her
yielding mood to grow upon her. I assured him evasively that she
would eventually succumb to his paternal authority and love.</p>
<p>What an inherent love we all have for meddling in the affairs of
others, and what a delicious zest we find in faithfully applying
our surplus energies to business that is not strictly our own! I
had become a part of the Sir George-Dorothy-John affair, and I was
like the man who caught the bear: I could not loose my hold.</p>

id="Page_281"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h2>PROUD DAYS FOR THE OLD HALL</h2>
<p>Of course the queen's approaching visit threw Haddon Hall into a
frenzy of scrubbing and furbishing. Aunt Dorothy was the busiest
woman in England. Floors were newly polished. Draperies were taken
down and were carefully washed with mysterious concoctions
warranted to remove dirt without injury to color. Superfine wax was
bought in great boxes, and candles were made for all the
chandeliers and candelabra in the house. Perfumed oil was purchased
for the lamp in the state bedroom. Elizabeth, by the way, when she
came, did not like the odor of the oil, and with an oath tossed
both the oil and the lamp out of the window. The fattest sheep,
kine, and hogs were chosen from the flocks and were brought in to
be stall-fed in such numbers that one might have supposed we were
expecting an ogress who could eat an ox at a meal. Pipers and
dancers were engaged, and a merry fool was brought down from
London. At last the eventful day came and with it came our queen.
She brought with her a hundred yeomen of her guard and a score of
ladies and gentlemen. Among the latter was the Earl of Leicester,
who was the queen's prime favorite.</p>
<p>Prior to the queen's announcement of her intention to visit
Haddon Sir George had, with Dorothy's tacit consent, fixed a day
upon which the Earl of Derby and his son, Lord James, should be
received at the Hall for the <a name="Page_282" id=
"Page_282"></a>purpose of signing the marriage contract. Dorothy,
of course, had no intention of signing the contract, but she put
off the evil hour of refusal as far as possible, hoping something
might occur in the meantime to help her out of the dilemma.
Something did occur at the last moment. I am eager to tell you
about it, but it must wait its turn. Truly would the story of this
ingenious girl's life make a romance if it were written by a poet.
In her Guinevere and Elaine were moulded into one person with the
tenderness, purity, and fierceness of each.</p>
<p>To postpone further the time of the Stanley visit, Dorothy
suggested that the betrothal should take place in the presence of
the queen. Sir George acquiesced, and in his heart grew less eager
for the Stanley match as Dorothy apparently became more tractable.
He was, however, engaged with the earl to an extent that forbade
withdrawal, even had he been sure that he wished to withdraw.</p>
<p>At the time of which I speak the Earl of Leicester was the most
exalted subject of the realm. He was ardently devoted to the cause
of the ladies, and, although he had fixed his hope on Elizabeth and
longed for a seat beside her on the throne, his inflammable heart
was constantly catching fire from other eyes. He, of course, made
desperate efforts to conceal these manifold conflagrations from the
queen, but the inflammable tow of his heart was always bringing him
into trouble with his fiery mistress.</p>
<p>The earl's first glance toward Dorothy was full of admiration.
The second glance was full of conflagration. The second day of the
queen's residence in Haddon I was astonished, grieved, and angered
to see that our girl had turned her powerful batteries upon the
earl with the evident purpose of conquest. At times her long lashes
would fall before him, and again her great luminous eyes would open
wide, shedding a soft radiance which no man could withstand. Once I
saw her walking alone with him upon <a name="Page_283" id=
"Page_283"></a>the terrace. Her head was drooped shamelessly, and
the earl was ardent though restless, being fearful of the queen. I
boiled with rage against Dorothy, but by a strong effort I did not
boil over until I had better cause. The better cause came
later.</p>
<p>I failed to tell you of a brief conversation which occurred
between Sir George and me after my cousin first saw the Earl of
Leicester. Sir George had gallantly led the queen to her
apartments, and I had conducted Leicester and several of the
gentlemen to their various rooms. Sir George and I met at the
staircase after we had quitted our guests.</p>
<p>He said: "Malcolm, that fellow Thomas whom I knocked in the head
looked no more like Leicester than I do. Why did you tell me there
was resemblance?"</p>
<p>"I do not know," I answered. "Perhaps your words suggested the
thought of a resemblance. Perhaps I had lost all memory of
Leicester's features. I cannot answer your question."</p>
<p>Then an expression of anger came to Sir George's face, and he
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I believe Dorothy lied to me when she said that the fellow
Thomas was of noble blood."</p>
<p>The next day a servant reported that Thomas had been seen
loitering near Bowling Green Gate, and Sir George ordered Dorothy
not to leave the Hall without his permission.</p>
<p>Dorothy replied to her father's command, "I shall obey you,
father."</p>
<p>To me there was a note of danger in her voice. Such docile
submissiveness was not natural to the girl. Of course all
appearance of harshness toward Dorothy was suppressed by Sir George
during the queen's visit to the Hall. In truth, he had no reason to
be harsh, for Dorothy was a meek, submissive, and obedient
daughter.<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a> Her meekness,
however, as you may well surmise, was but the forerunner of dire
rebellion.</p>
<p>The fourth day of the queen's presence at Haddon Hall was the
one appointed for the visit of the Stanleys, and Sir George thought
to make a great event of the betrothal by having the queen act as a
witness to the marriage contract. As the day approached Sir George
became thoughtful, while Dorothy grew gleeful. The girl was
frequently seen with Leicester, and Sir George could not help
noticing that nobleman's pronounced admiration for his daughter.
These exhibitions of gallantry were never made in the presence of
the queen. The morning of the day when the Stanleys were expected
Sir George called me to his room for a private consultation. The
old gentleman was in a state of excitement, not unmixed with
perplexity and trouble.</p>
<p>He said, "I have great and good news to impart to you, Malcolm;
yet I am in a dilemma growing out of it."</p>
<p>"Tell me the good news first, Sir George," I replied. "The
dilemma may wait."</p>
<p>"Is Doll a very beautiful girl?" he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"I believe she is the most beautiful woman in the world," I
answered.</p>
<p>"Good, good," he replied, rubbing his hands. "Is she so
fascinating, brilliant, and attractive, think you&mdash;of course I
speak in jest&mdash;but think you she might vie with the court
ladies for beauty, and think you she might attract&mdash;for the
sake of illustration I will say&mdash;might she attract a man like
Leicester?"</p>
<p>"Unless I am much mistaken," I answered, "Leicester is over his
ears in love with the girl now."</p>
<p>"Ah, do you believe so, Malcolm?" replied Sir George, laughing
and slapping his thigh, as he walked to and fro across the room.
"You have seen so much of that sort of <a name="Page_285" id=
"Page_285"></a>thing that you should know it when it comes under
your nose. Eh, Malcolm, eh?"</p>
<p>"I should suppose that any one, however inexperienced in such
matters, could easily see Leicester's infatuation for Dorothy. If
you wish me to tell you what I really believe&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I do, I do," interrupted Sir George.</p>
<p>"I should say," I continued, "that Dorothy has deliberately gone
in for conquest. Leave the girl to herself, Sir George. She can
conduct the campaign without help from any one. She understands the
art of such warfare as well as if she were a veteran."</p>
<p>"Gad, but she does, but she does. I believe she could give Venus
herself some good points in the matter. But let me tell you,
Malcolm,"&mdash;the old man dropped his voice to a
whisper,&mdash;"I questioned Doll this morning, and she confessed
that Leicester had spoken words of love to her. Would it not be a
great match for our house?"</p>
<p>He said "our house," mind you, not "our Doll." I might call his
condition of mind patrimonial selfishness. Simple old man! He did
not know that words of love are not necessarily words of
marriage.</p>
<p>"Has Leicester spoken to you?" I asked in alarm for John's
sake.</p>
<p>"No, no, he has not spoken," returned my cousin; "for that, of
course, he must have the queen's consent. But he will speak, I am
sure, all in good time, Malcolm, all in good time."</p>
<p>"How about the Stanleys?" I asked. "They will be here this
afternoon."</p>
<p>"That's the devil's finger in the matter," cried Sir George.
"That's where my dilemma lies. How shall I put them off, and still
retain them in case nothing should come from Leicester? Besides, I
am in honor bound to the earl."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>I have a plan," I replied.
"You carry out your part of the agreement with the earl, but let
Dorothy, at the last moment, refuse to give her consent. Let her
ask for more time, on the plea that she does not know her mind. I
will suggest to her, if you wish, the part she is to play; but I
will conceal from her the fact that you are a party to it."</p>
<p>"No," said the old man, "that would be bad faith toward the
earl." After a pause he continued doubtingly: "No, do not speak to
Doll. I believe she needs no suggestions in the matter. I fear that
mischief is in her mind already. Her easy acquiescence in my wishes
have of late had a suspicious appearance. No, don't speak to her,
Malcolm. If ever there lived a girl who could be perverse and
wilful on her own account, without help from any one, it is my girl
Doll. God bless you, man, if she but knew that I wanted her to
reject Stanley, she would have him in spite of hell itself. I
wonder what she means by her docility and obedience? No, don't
speak a word to her on the subject. Let her believe I am serious
regarding this marriage, and she will have some plan of her own to
raise the devil. I have been expecting signs of it every day. I had
determined not to bear with her perversity, but now that the
Leicester possibility has come up we'll leave Doll to work out her
own salvation, Malcolm. Don't interfere. No man living can teach
that girl a new trick in deviltry. Gods, Malcolm! I am curious to
know what she will be doing, for she certainly will be doing
something rather than sign that contract of betrothal."</p>
<p>"But suppose out of obedience to you she should sign the
contract?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Malcolm, you don't know Doll," he replied. Then, after a pause,
"Neither do I. I wish she were well married."</p>
<p>When I left Sir George, I found Dorothy in close con<a name=
"Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>sultation with the queen and two of
her ladies. I heard the name of Lord James Stanley spoken amid
suppressed laughter, and I suspected Dorothy had on foot some prank
touching that young man, to which her Majesty was a party.</p>
<p>After dinner the Stanleys came a-wooing. The party consisted of
father, son, and four retainers, who looked as if they had been
preserved in alcohol for the occasion, so red were their faces.</p>
<p>The Earl of Derby was a fine old gentleman of the rural type.
His noble son was an uncouth rustic, who had no thought above a
stable boy or tavern maid, nor any ambition above horse trading.
His attire was a wonder to behold. He wore a ruff of stupendous
proportions. His trunks were so puffed out and preposterous in size
that they looked like a great painted knot on a tree; and the
many-colored splendors of his sleeves, his hat, his hose, and his
shoes were dazzling to the eye. Add to this wondrous raiment feet
and hands that could not be satisfactorily disposed of, and an
unrest of manner painful to behold, and you may possibly conceive
the grandiose absurdity of Dorothy's wooer. The sight of him almost
made Sir George ill; and his entrance into the long gallery, where
the queen was seated with her ladies and gentlemen, and Sir George
and his friends standing about her, was a signal for laughter in
which her Majesty openly joined.</p>
<p>I shall not lead you through the tedious ceremony of
presentation and introduction, nor shall I tell you of the pompous
manner in which one of the earl's retinue, a lawyer, read the
marriage contract. The fact that the contract was read without the
presence of Dorothy, whom it so nearly concerned, was significant
of the small consideration which at that time was given to a girl's
consent. When all was ready for the signing, Dorothy was
summoned.</p>
<p><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>Sir George stood beside the
Stanleys, and his nervousness was painfully apparent. Two servants
opened the great doors at the end of the long gallery, and Dorothy,
holding up the skirt of her gown, bounded into the room. She
kneeled to the queen, and turned toward her uncle Stanley and her
lover-cousin with a low bow. Then she courtesied and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>"Good even, uncle, and how do you do, cousin. Have you come to
inspect me, and, perchance, to buy?"</p>
<p>Sir George's face bore an expression of mingled shame, wonder,
and alarm, and the queen and her suite laughed behind their
fans.</p>
<p>"It is well," continued Dorothy. "Here am I, ready for
inspection." Thereupon she began to disrobe herself before the
entire company. Leicester laughed outright, and the queen and her
ladies suppressed their merriment for a moment, and then sent forth
peals of laughter without restraint. Sir George stepped toward the
girl and raised his hand warningly, but the queen
interposed:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Silence, Sir George, I command you;" and Sir George retreated
to his former place beside the Earl of Derby. Dorothy first removed
her bodice, showing her shoulders and a part of her arms, clothed
in the fashion of a tavern maid.</p>
<p>Leicester, who stood by me, whispered, "God never made anything
more beautiful than Mistress Vernon's arms."</p>
<p>Sir George again spoke angrily, "Doll, what are you doing?" But
the queen by a wave of her hand commanded silence. Then the girl
put her hands behind her, and loosened the belt which held her
skirt in place. The skirt fell to the floor, and out of it bounded
Dorothy in the short gown of a maid.</p>
<p>"You will be better able to judge of me in this costume,
cousin," said Dorothy. "It will be more familiar to you than the
gowns which ladies wear."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>I will retract," said
Leicester, whispering to me, and gazing ardently at Dorothy's
ankles. "God has made something more beautiful than Mistress
Vernon's arms. By Venus! I suppose that in His omnipotence He might
be able to create something more beautiful than her ankles, but up
to this time He has not vouchsafed to me a vision of it. Ah! did
any one ever behold such strength, such perfect symmetry,
such&mdash;St. George! the gypsy doesn't live who can dance like
that."</p>
<p>Sure enough, Dorothy was dancing. The pipers in the balcony had
burst forth in a ribald jig of a tune, and the girl was whirling in
a wild, weird, and wondrous dance before her lover-cousin. Sir
George ordered the pipers to cease playing; but again Elizabeth,
who was filled with mirth, interrupted, and the music pealed forth
in wanton volumes which flooded the gallery. Dorothy danced like an
elfin gypsy to the inspiring strains. Soon her dance changed to
wondrous imitations of the movements of a horse. She walked
sedately around in an ever increasing circle; she trotted and
paced; she gave the single foot and racked; she galloped, slowly
for a while, and then the gallop merged into a furious run which
sent the blood of her audience thrilling through their veins with
delight. The wondrous ease and grace, and the marvellous strength
and quickness of her movements, cannot be described. I had never
before thought the human body capable of such grace and agility as
she displayed.</p>
<p>After her dance was finished she stepped in front of her cousin
and delivered herself as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am sound from ear tip to fetlock. There is not a blemish in
me."</p>
<p>"No, by my faith, I will swear there is not!" cried the Earl of
Leicester.</p>
<p>"I have good wind," continued Dorothy, "two good eyes. By night
or by day I can see everything within <a name="Page_290" id=
"Page_290"></a>the range of my vision, and a great deal that is
not. I shy, at times, when an uncouth object suddenly comes upon
me. I am warranted gentle if properly handled, but otherwise it is
unsafe to curry my heels."</p>
<p>Sir George could no longer restrain himself, and again tried to
prevent Dorothy from proceeding with her terrible insult to the
Stanleys. The queen, however, was determined to see the end of the
frolic, and she said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Proceed, Mistress Vernon, proceed."</p>
<p>Dorothy, nothing loath, continued: "As for my disposition, it
might be better. It probably will improve with age, if it doesn't
grow worse. I have all the gaits a horse should have. I am four
years old, I have never been trained to work double, and I think I
never shall be. What think you? Now what have you to offer in
exchange? Step out and let me see you move."</p>
<p>She took the poor youth by the hand and led him to the middle of
the floor.</p>
<p>"How old are you? Show me your teeth," she said. The heir to
Derby smiled uneasily, and drew his hand across his nose.</p>
<p>"Ah, you have a touch of the distemper, I see. Are you subject
to it?"</p>
<p>Stanley smiled, and the earl said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sir George, this insult has gone far enough."</p>
<p>"Stand back, my Lord Derby," said the queen. "Do not interfere
with this interesting barter."</p>
<p>The earl reluctantly lapsed into silence. He remembered the
insult of her Majesty's words all his life.</p>
<p>"Now step off," said Dorothy to Lord James.</p>
<p>The young man stood in helpless confusion. Dorothy took a step
backward from him, and after watching Stanley a moment
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What! You can neither trot, pace, nor gallop? I don't believe
you can even walk alone." Then she turned <a name="Page_291" id=
"Page_291"></a>toward Sir George. A smile was on her lips, but a
look from hell was in her eyes as she said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Father, take a lesson from this day. I gave you fair warning.
Bring me no more scurvy cobs for barter nor trade." Then she turned
to the Earl of Derby and to her cousin Lord James, made a deep
courtesy, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You can have no barter with me. Good day."</p>
<p>She ran from the room, and a great peal of laughter from all
save Sir George and the Stanleys followed her as she passed out
through the double door. When the laughter had subsided, the Earl
of Derby turned to Sir George and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sir George, this insult is unbearable, and I shall expect
satisfaction for it." Then he turned to the queen: "I beg that your
Majesty will give me leave to depart with my son."</p>
<p>"Granted," answered Elizabeth, and father and son started to
leave the room, moving backward toward the great doors. Sir George
asked the earl and Lord Stanley to remain, and in the presence of
the company who had witnessed the insult, he in the humblest manner
made abject apology for the treatment his distinguished guests had
received at the hands of his daughter. He very honestly and in all
truth disclaimed any sympathy with Dorothy's conduct, and offered,
as the only reparation he could make, to punish her in some way
befitting the offence. Then he conducted the guests to the mounting
block near the entrance tower and saw them depart. Dorothy had
solved her father's dilemma with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Sir George was not sure that he wanted to be angry at Dorothy,
though he felt it was a duty he owed to himself and to the
Stanleys. He had wished that the girl would in some manner defer
the signing of the contract, but he had not wanted her to refuse
young Stanley's hand in a manner so insulting that the match would
be broken off altogether.</p>
<p><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>As the day progressed, and
as Sir George pondered over Dorothy's conduct, he grew more
inclined to anger; but during the afternoon she kept well under the
queen's wing, and he found no opportunity to give vent to his
ill-temper.</p>
<p>Late that night he called me to his room. He had been drinking
during the evening and was poised between good-humored hilarity and
ill-tempered ferocity. The latter condition was usually the result
of his libations. When I entered the room it was evident he was
amused.</p>
<p>"Did you ever hear or see such brazen effrontery?" he asked,
referring to Dorothy's treatment of the Stanleys. "Is there another
girl on earth who would have conceived the absurd thought, or,
having conceived it, would have dared to carry it out?"</p>
<p>I took a chair and replied, "I think there is not another."</p>
<p>"I hope not," continued Sir George. He sat in thought for a
moment, and then broke forth into a great laugh. When he had
finished laughing he said: "I admit it was laughable and&mdash;and
pretty&mdash;beautiful. Damme, I didn't know the girl could do it,
Malcolm! I didn't know she had it in her. There is not another girl
living could have carried the frolic through." Then he spoke
seriously, "But I will make her smart for it when the queen leaves
Haddon."</p>
<p>"Sir George, if you will allow me to suggest what I feel on the
subject, I would say that you have no reason whatever for desiring
to make Dorothy smart. She may have deeper designs than we can
see."</p>
<p>"What designs do you suppose she can have? Tell me, Malcolm,"
asked Sir George.</p>
<p>I remained silent for a moment, hardly knowing how to express my
thought. "Certainly she could not have appeared to a better
advantage than in her tavern maid's costume," I said.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>That is true," answered
Sir George. "Though she is my own daughter, I must admit that I
have never seen any woman so beautiful as she." The old gentleman
laughed softly for a moment and said: "But wasn't it brazen? Wasn't
it shameless? I have always given the girl credit for modesty,
but&mdash;damme, damme&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Her beauty in the tavern maid's costume fired Leicester's heart
as nothing else could have done," I said. "He stood by my side, and
was in raptures over her charms."</p>
<p>Sir George mused a moment and said something about the
"Leicester possibility," which I knew to be an impossibility, and
before I left him he had determined to allow the matter to drop for
the present. "I am making a damned pretty mess of the whole affair,
I fear, Malcolm," he said.</p>
<p>"You don't seem to be clearing it up, Sir George," I
responded.</p>
<p>After talking over some arrangements for the queen's
entertainment, I said good night, and left my cousin brooding over
as complicated a problem as man ever tried to solve.</p>
<p>The next morning I told Dorothy how her father felt with respect
to the "Leicester possibility." She laughed and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I will encourage father in that matter, and," with a saucy
twinkle in her eye, "incidentally I will not discourage my proud
lord of Leicester. I will make the most of the situation, fear not,
Malcolm."</p>
<p>"I do not fear," said I, emphatically.</p>
<p>There it was: the full-blown spirit of conquest, strong even in
a love-full heart. God breathed into Adam the breath of life; but
into Eve he breathed the love of conquest, and it has been growing
stronger in the hearts of her daughters with each recurring
generation.</p>
<p>"How about John?" I asked.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>Oh, John?" she answered,
throwing her head contemplatively to one side. "He is amply able to
protect his own interests. I could not be really untrue to him if I
wished to be. It is I who am troubled on the score of infidelity.
John will be with the most beautiful queen&mdash;" She broke off in
the midst of her sentence, and her face became clouded with an
expression of anger and hatred. "God curse her! I wish she were
dead, dead, dead. There! you know how I feel toward your
English-French-Scottish beauty. Curse the mongrel&mdash;" She
halted before the ugly word she was about to use; but her eyes were
like glowing embers, and her cheeks were flushed by the heat of
anger.</p>
<p>"Did you not promise me, Dorothy, that you would not again allow
yourself to become jealous of Queen Mary?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I promised, but I cannot prevent the jealousy, and I do
not intend to try. I hate her, and I love to hate her."</p>
<p>"Why should you hate her?" I asked. "If John remains true to
you, there is certainly no cause for you to hate any one. If he
should be untrue to you, you should hate him."</p>
<p>"Hate him?" she exclaimed. "That, indeed, is pretty reasoning.
If he should be untrue to me, I should of course hate her. I could
not hate him. I did not make myself love him. I would never have
been so great a fool as to bring that pain upon myself
intentionally. I suppose no girl would deliberately make herself
love a man and bring into her heart so great an agony. I feel
toward John as I do, because I must; and I hate your Scottish
mongrel because I must. I tell you, Malcolm, when she comes to
Rutland, if I hear of her trying any of her wanton tricks on John
there will be trouble&mdash;mark my words!"</p>
<p>"I ask you to promise me this, Dorothy: that you will <a name=
"Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>do nothing concerning John and Queen
Mary without first speaking to me."</p>
<p>She paced across the room angrily. "I promise you nothing,
Malcolm, save that I shall not allow that woman to come between
John and me. That I promise you, on my oath."</p>
<p>Dorothy continued to shed her luminous smiles on Leicester,
though she was careful not to shine in the queen's presence. My
lord was dazzled by the smiles, and continually sought
opportunities to bask in their dangerous light. As a result of this
smiling and basking the great London heart-breaker was soon
helplessly caught in the toils of Doll, the country maiden. She
played him as an angler plays a trout. The most experienced court
coquette could not have done the part better than did this girl,
whose knowledge of the subject was wholly intuitive, for her life
had all been spent amid the green hills and groves of Derbyshire.
She so managed the affair that her father should see enough of
Leicester's preference to keep alive in Sir George's mind the hope
for the "Leicester possibility." Those words had become with her a
phrase slyly to play upon.</p>
<p>One afternoon when the sun was graciously warm and bright, I
induced Madge to walk with me upon the terrace, that I might for a
few moments feel the touch of her hand and hear her whispered
words. We took a seat by a large holly bush, which effectually
concealed us from view. We had been there but a few moments when we
heard footsteps approaching. Looking between the branches of the
holly bush I saw Dorothy and Leicester coming toward us from the
north end of the terrace. Dorothy's eyes were cast down demurely,
and her head hung in the attitude of a shy, modest girl, who
listens timidly to words that are music in her ears. Never have I
seen an attitude more indicative of the receptive mood than that
which Dorothy assumed toward Leicester.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>Ah," thought I, "poor John
has given his heart and has risked his life for the sake of Doll,
and Doll is a miserable coquette."</p>
<p>But there was conduct still more objectionable to come from
Dorothy.</p>
<p>Unconscious of our presence, Leicester said, "My fair beauty, my
Venus, here is a settle under this holly bush, well hidden from
prying eyes. It invites us. Will you sit here with me for one happy
moment, and give me a taste of Paradise?"</p>
<p>"I fear I should not sit with you, my lord, however much
I&mdash;may&mdash;may wish to do so. My father or the queen might
observe us." The black lashes fell upon the fair cheek, and the red
golden head with its crown of glory hung forward convincingly.</p>
<p>"You false jade," thought I.</p>
<p>"I ask for but one moment," pleaded Leicester. "The queen sleeps
at this time after dinner, and perhaps your father would not object
if you were to grant this little favor to the first nobleman of the
realm."</p>
<p>"You do not know my father, my lord. He is very strict regarding
my conduct," murmured the drooping head.</p>
<p>"I ask for but one little moment," continued the earl, "in which
to tell you that you have filled my heart with adoration and
love."</p>
<p>"I should not listen to you, my lord. Were I mindful of my
happiness, I should return to the Hall at once," said the drooping
lashes and hanging head.</p>
<p>"You lying wench," thought I. By that time I was thoroughly
angered.</p>
<p>"Only one little moment on the settle," pleaded Leicester, "that
I may speak to you that which I wish so ardently to say."</p>
<p>"Can you not speak while we walk, my lord?" asked Dorothy.</p>
<p><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>I felt a bitter desire to
curse the girl.</p>
<p>"It is difficult for me to speak while we walk," said Leicester,
cautiously taking the girl's hand; so she permitted him to lead her
to the settle under the holly bush, on the opposite side of which
Madge and I were sitting.</p>
<p>The earl retained the hand for a moment after he and Dorothy
were seated, but she gently drew it away and moved a little
distance from his Lordship. Still, her eyes were drooped, her head
hung low, and her bosom actually heaved as if with emotion.</p>
<p>"I will tell John of your shamelessness," I said to myself. "He
shall feel no more heartaches for you&mdash;you wanton huzzy."</p>
<p>Then Leicester poured forth his passion most eloquently. Poesy,
verse, and rhetoric all came to help him in his wooing. Now and
then the girl would respond to his ardor with "Please, my lord," or
"I pray you, my lord," and when he would try to take her hand she
would say, "I beg you, my lord, do not." But Leicester evidently
thought that the "do not" meant "do," for soon he began to steal
his arm about her waist, and she was so slow in stopping him that I
thought she was going to submit. She, however, arose gently to her
feet and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My lord, I must return to the Hall. I may not longer remain
here with you."</p>
<p>The earl caught her hand and endeavored to kiss it, but she
adroitly prevented him, and stepping out into the path, started
slowly toward the Hall. She turned her head slightly toward
Leicester in a mute but eloquent invitation, and he quickly
followed her.</p>
<p>I watched the pair walk up the terrace. They descended the steps
to the garden, and from thence they entered the Hall by way of the
porch.</p>
<p>"Was it not very wicked in Dorothy to listen to such <a name=
"Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>words from Leicester?" asked Madge. "I
do not at all understand her."</p>
<p>Madge, of course, knew only a part of what had happened, and a
very small part at that, for she had not seen Dorothy. Madge and I
returned to the Hall, and we went at once to Dorothy's room, hoping
to see her, and intending to tell her our opinion of the shameless
manner in which she had acted.</p>
<p>Dorothy was in her room alone when we entered. She clapped her
hands, ran to the door, bolted it, and bounded back toward us.</p>
<p>"I have the greatest news to tell you," she cried
laughingly,&mdash;"the greatest news and the greatest sport of
which you ever heard. My lord Leicester is in love with me."</p>
<p>"Indeed, that is very fine," I responded; but my irony met its
usual fate. She did not see it.</p>
<p>"Yes," continued Dorothy, brimming over with mirth, "you should
have heard him pleading with me a few moments since upon the
terrace."</p>
<p>"We did hear him," said Madge.</p>
<p>"You heard him? Where? How?" Her eyes were wide with wonder.</p>
<p>"We were on the opposite side of the holly bush from you," I
answered. "We heard him and we saw you."</p>
<p>"Did you? Good. I am glad of it," said Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Yes, we saw and we heard all, and we think that your conduct
was shameless," I responded severely.</p>
<p>"Shameless?" demanded Dorothy. "Now pray tell me what I did or
said that was shameless.".</p>
<p>I was at a loss to define the wrong in her conduct, for it had
been of an intangible quality which in itself was nothing, but
notwithstanding meant a great deal.</p>
<p>"You permitted him to hold your hand," I said, trying to fix on
something real with which to accuse her.</p>
<p>"I did nothing of the sort," said Dorothy, laughingly.<a name=
"Page_299" id="Page_299"></a> "He caught my hand several times, but
I withdrew it from him"</p>
<p>I knew she spoke the truth regarding her hand, so I tried
again.</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you hung your head and kept your eyes cast down, and
you looked&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I hung my head, I cast down my eyes, and I looked?" she
answered, laughing heartily. "Pray let me ask you, Master
Fault-finder, for what use else are heads and eyes made?"</p>
<p>I was not prepared to say that the uses to which Dorothy had put
her head and eyes were not some of the purposes for which they were
created. They are good purposes, too, I admit, although I would not
have conceded as much to Dorothy. I knew the girl would soon
wheedle me into her way of thinking, so I took a bold stand and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is my intention to tell John about your conduct with
Leicester, and I shall learn for what purpose he thinks eyes and
heads are created."</p>
<p>"Tell John?" cried Dorothy. "Of course you may tell John. He
well knows the purposes of heads and eyes, and their proper uses.
He has told me many times his opinion on the subject." She laughed
for a moment, and then continued: "I, too, shall tell John all that
happened or shall happen between Lord Leicester and me. I wish I
could tell him now. How I wish I could tell him now." A soft light
came to her eyes, and she repeated huskily: "If I might tell him
now; if I might tell him now. Why, Malcolm, I despise Leicester. He
is a poor, weak fool. He has no more force nor strength than I
have. He is not a man. He is no more attractive than a woman. He
wanted to kiss me. He begged me to give him but one. It is but a
poor kiss which a man gets by begging. Think you I would give him
one? Had he but touched my lips, think you I would ever allow John
to soil himself again by kissing them? Fear not, Malcolm.<a name=
"Page_300" id="Page_300"></a> Fear not for John nor for me. No man
will ever receive from me a favor, the granting of which would make
me unfit to be John's&mdash;John's wife. I have paid too dearly for
him to throw him away for a penny whistle that I do not want." Then
she grew earnest, with a touch of anger: "Leicester! What reason,
suppose you, Malcolm, have I for treating him as I do? Think you I
act from sheer wantonness? If there were one little spot of that
fault upon my soul, I would tear myself from John, though I should
die for it."</p>
<p>Her laughing mood had passed away, and I feared to say that I
could see no reason other than coquetry for her conduct, I feared
the red-haired tigress would scratch my eyes out.</p>
<p>"I have wanted to see you," she continued, "that I might tell
you of my plans and of the way they are working out, but now since
you have spoken to me in this manner, Sir Malcolm Fran&ccedil;ois
de Lorraine Vernon, I shall tell you nothing. You suspect me.
Therefore, you shall wait with the rest of the world to learn my
purposes. You may tell John all you have seen and heard. I care not
how quickly you do it." Then with a sigh: "I pray God it may be
very soon. He will wish for no explanation, and he shall one day
have in me a rich reward for his faith."</p>
<p>"Do you trust him as he trusts you?" I asked, "and would you
demand an explanation were he to act toward Mary Stuart as you have
acted toward Leicester?"</p>
<p>"He could not act toward her as I did toward Lord Leicester,"
she said thoughtfully. Then after a moment she laughingly
continued: "John can't&mdash;he can't hang his head and&mdash;droop
his eyes and look."</p>
<p>"But if&mdash;" I began.</p>
<p>"I want no more of your hellish 'ifs,'" cried the girl in sudden
fury. "If John were to&mdash;to look at that Scottish mongrel as I
looked at Leicester, I would&mdash;I would kill the royal wanton. I
would kill her if it cost my life.<a name="Page_301" id=
"Page_301"></a> Now, for God's sake, leave me. You see the state
into which you have wrought me." I left Madge with Dorothy and
walked out upon Bowling Green to ponder on the events that were
passing before me.</p>
<p>From the time we learned that John had gone to fetch the
Scottish queen I had fears lest Dorothy's inflammable jealousy
might cause trouble, and now those fears were rapidly transforming
themselves into a feeling of certainty. There is nothing in life so
sweet and so dangerous as the love of a hot-blooded woman.</p>
<p>I soon saw Dorothy again. "Tell me," said I, in conciliation,
"tell me, please, what is your reason for acting as you do toward
Leicester, and why should you look differently upon similar conduct
on John's part?"</p>
<p>"I will not tell you my plans," she responded,&mdash;"not now,
at least. Perhaps I shall do so when I have recovered from my
ill-temper. It is hard for me to give my reasons for feeling
differently about like conduct on John's part. Perhaps I feel as I
do because&mdash;because&mdash;It is this way: While I might do
little things&mdash;mere nothings&mdash;such as I have
done&mdash;it would be impossible for me to do any act of
unfaithfulness to John. Oh, it could not be. But with him,
he&mdash;he&mdash;well, he is a man and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, don't
talk to me! Don't talk to me! You are driving me mad. Out of my
sight! Out of my room! Holy Virgin! I shall die before I have him;
I know I shall."</p>
<p>There it was again. The thought of Mary Stuart drove her wild.
Dorothy threw herself on her face upon the bed, and Madge went over
and sat by her side to soothe her. I, with a feeling of guilt, so
adroit had been Dorothy's defence, left the girls and went to my
room in the tower to unravel, by the help of my pipe, the tangled
web of woman's incomprehensibility. I failed, as many another man
had failed before me, and as men will continue to fail to the end
of time.</p>

id="Page_302"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h2>MARY STUART</h2>
<p>And now I come to an event in this history which I find
difficult to place before you in its true light. For Dorothy's sake
I wish I might omit it altogether. But in true justice to her and
for the purpose of making you see clearly the enormity of her fault
and the palliating excuses therefor, if any there were, I shall
pause briefly to show the condition of affairs at the time of which
I am about to write&mdash;a time when Dorothy's madness brought us
to the most terrible straits and plunged us into deepest
tribulations.</p>
<p>Although I have been unable to show you as much of John as I
have wished you to see, you nevertheless must know that he, whose
nature was not like the shallow brook but was rather of the quality
of a deep, slow-moving river, had caught from Dorothy an infection
of love from which he would never recover. His soul was steeped in
the delicious essence of the girl. I would also call your attention
to the conditions under which his passion for Dorothy had arisen.
It is true he received the shaft when first he saw her at the Royal
Arms in Derby-town, but the shaft had come from Dorothy's eyes.
Afterward she certainly had done her full part in the wooing. It
was for her sake, after she had drawn him on to love her, that he
became a servant in Haddon Hall. For her sake he faced death at the
hands of her father. And it was through her mad <a name="Page_303"
id="Page_303"></a>fault that the evil came upon him of which I
shall now tell you. That she paid for her fault in suffering does
not excuse her, since pain is but the latter half of evil.</p>
<p>During the term of Elizabeth's residence in Haddon Hall John
returned to Rutland with Queen Mary Stuart, whose escape from
Lochleven had excited all England. The country was full of rumors
that Mary was coming to England not so much for sanctuary as to be
on the ground ready to accept the English crown when her
opportunity to do so should occur. The Catholics, a large and
powerful party, flushed with their triumphs under the "Bloody
Queen," were believed to sympathize with Mary's cause. Although
Elizabeth said little on the subject, she felt deeply, and she
feared trouble should the Scottish queen enter her dominion.
Another cause of annoyance to Elizabeth was the memory that
Leicester had once been deeply impressed with Mary's charms, and
had sought her hand in marriage. Elizabeth's prohibition alone had
prevented the match. That thought rankled in Elizabeth's heart, and
she hated Mary, although her hatred, as in all other cases, was
tempered with justice and mercy. This great queen had the brain of
a man with its motives, and the heart of a woman with its
emotions.</p>
<p>When news of Mary's escape reached London, Cecil came in great
haste to Haddon. During a consultation with Elizabeth he advised
her to seize Mary, should she enter England, and to check the plots
made in Mary's behalf by executing the principal friends of the
Scottish queen. He insistently demanded that Elizabeth should keep
Mary under lock and key, should she be so fortunate as to obtain
possession of her person, and that the men who were instrumental in
bringing her into England should be arraigned for high treason.</p>
<p>John certainly had been instrumental in bringing her into
England, and if Cecil's advice were taken by the <a name="Page_304"
id="Page_304"></a>queen, John's head would pay the forfeit for his
chivalric help to Mary.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was loath to act on this advice, but Cecil worked upon
her fears and jealousies until her mind and her heart were in
accord, and she gave secret orders that his advice should be
carried out. Troops were sent to the Scottish border to watch for
the coming of the fugitive queen. But Mary was already ensconced,
safely, as she thought, in Rutland Castle under the assumed name of
Lady Blanche. Her presence at Rutland was, of course, guarded as a
great secret.</p>
<p>Dorothy's mind dwelt frequently upon the fact that John and the
beautiful young Scottish queen lived under the same roof, for John
had written to Dorothy immediately after his return. Nothing so
propagates itself as jealousy. There were in Haddon Hall two hearts
in which this self-propagating process was rapidly
progressing&mdash;Elizabeth's and Dorothy's. Each had for the cause
of her jealousy the same woman.</p>
<p>One night, soon after Cecil had obtained from Elizabeth the
order for Mary's arrest, Dorothy, on retiring to her room at a late
hour found Jennie Faxton waiting for her with a precious letter
from John. Dorothy drank in the tenderness of John's letter as the
thirsty earth absorbs the rain; but her joy was neutralized by
frequent references to the woman who she feared might become her
rival. One-half of what she feared, she was sure had been
accomplished: that is, Mary's half. She knew in her heart that the
young queen would certainly grow fond of John. That was a foregone
conclusion. No woman could be with him and escape that fate,
thought Dorothy. Her hope as to the other half-John's part-rested
solely upon her faith in John, which was really great, and her
confidence in her own charms and in her own power to hold him,
which in truth, and with good reason, was not small,<a name=
"Page_305" id="Page_305"></a> Dorothy went to bed, and Jennie,
following her usual custom, when at Haddon, lay upon the floor in
the same room. John's letter, with all its tenderness, had thrown
Dorothy into an inquisitive frame of mind. After an hour or two of
restless tossing upon the bed she fell asleep, but soon after
midnight she awakened, and in her drowsy condition the devil
himself played upon the strings of her dream-charged imagination.
After a time she sprang from the bed, lighted a candle at the rush
light, and read John's letter in a tremor of dream-wrought fear.
Then she aroused Jennie Faxton and asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"When were you at Rutland?"</p>
<p>"I spent yesterday and to-day there, mistress," answered
Jennie.</p>
<p>"Did you see a strange lady?" asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, mistress, I did see her three or four times," answered
Jennie. "Lady Blanche is her name, and she be a cousin of Sir
John's. She do come, they say, from France, and do speak only in
the tongue of that country."</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I suppose that this&mdash;this Lady Blanche
and&mdash;and Sir John are very good friends? Did you&mdash;did
you&mdash;often see them together?" asked Dorothy. She felt guilty
in questioning Jennie for the purpose of spying upon her lover. She
knew that John would not pry into her conduct.</p>
<p>"Indeed, yes, mistress," returned Jennie, who admired John
greatly from her lowly sphere, and who for her own sake as well as
Dorothy's was jealous of Queen Mary. "They do walk together a great
deal on the ramparts, and the white snaky lady do look up into Sir
John's face like this"&mdash;here Jennie assumed a lovelorn
expression. "And&mdash;and once, mistress, I thought&mdash;I
thought&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, Jesu!" hissed Dorothy, clutching Jennie by the arm,
"you thought, you thought. Tell me! Tell me! What in hell's name
did you think? Speak quickly, wench."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>I be not sure, mistress,
but I thought I saw his arm about her waist one evening on the
ramparts. It was dark, and for sure I could not tell,
but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"God's curse upon the white huzzy!" screamed Dorothy. "God's
curse upon her! She is stealing him from me, and I am
helpless."</p>
<p>She clasped her hands over the top of her head and ran to and
fro across the room uttering inarticulate cries of agony. Then she
sat upon the bedside and threw herself into Madge's arms, crying
under her breath: "My God! My God! Think of it, Madge. I have given
him my heart, my soul, O merciful God, my love&mdash;all that I
have worth giving, and now comes this white wretch, and because she
is a queen and was sired in hell she tries to steal him from me and
coaxes him to put his arm around her waist."</p>
<p>"Don't feel that way about it, Dorothy," said Madge, soothingly.
"I know Sir John can explain it all to you when you see him. He is
true to you, I am sure."</p>
<p>"True to me, Madge! How can he be true to me if she coaxes him
to woo her and if he puts his arm&mdash;I am losing him; I know it.
I&mdash;I&mdash;O God, Madge, I am smothering; I am strangling!
Holy Virgin! I believe I am about to die." She threw herself upon
the bed by Madge's side, clutching her throat and breast, and her
grand woman's form tossed and struggled as if she were in
convulsions.</p>
<p>"Holy mother!" she cried, "take this frightful agony from my
breast. Snatch this terrible love from my heart. God! If you have
pity, give it now. Help me! Help me! Ah, how deeply I love. I never
loved him so much as I do at this awful moment. Save me from doing
that which is in my heart. If I could have him for only one little
portion of a minute. But that is denied me whose right it is, and
is given to her who has <a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>no
right. Ah, God is not just. If he were he would strike her dead. I
hate her and I hate&mdash;hate him."</p>
<p>She arose to a sitting posture on the edge of the bed and held
out her arms toward Madge.</p>
<p>"Madge," she continued, frenzied by the thought, "his arm was
around her waist. That was early in the evening. Holy Virgin! What
may be happening now?"</p>
<p>Dorothy sprang from the bed and staggered about the room with
her hands upon her throbbing temples.</p>
<p>"I cannot bear this agony. God give me strength." Soon she began
to gasp for breath. "I can&mdash;see&mdash;them now&mdash;together,
together. I hate her; I hate him. My love has turned bitter. What
can I do? What can I do? I will do it. I will. I will disturb their
sweet rest. If I cannot have him, she shall not. I'll tell the
queen, I'll tell the queen."</p>
<p>Dorothy acted on her resolution the moment it was taken, and at
once began to unbolt the door.</p>
<p>"Stay, Dorothy, stay!" cried Madge. "Think on what you are about
to do. It will cost John his life. Come to me for one moment,
Dorothy, I pray you." Madge arose from the bed and began groping
her way toward Dorothy, who was unbolting the door.</p>
<p>Madge could have calmed the tempest-tossed sea as easily as she
could have induced Dorothy to pause in her mad frenzy. Jennie
Faxton, almost paralyzed by fear of the storm she had raised, stood
in the corner of the room trembling and speechless. Dorothy was out
of the room before poor blind Madge could reach her. The frenzied
girl was dressed only in her night robes and her glorious hair hung
dishevelled down to her waist. She ran through the rooms of Lady
Crawford and those occupied by her father and the retainers. Then
she sped down the long gallery and up the steps to Elizabeth's
apartment.</p>
<p>She knocked violently at the queen's door.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>Who comes?" demanded one
of her Majesty's ladies.</p>
<p>"I, Dorothy," was the response. "I wish to speak to her Majesty
at once upon a matter of great importance to her."</p>
<p>Elizabeth ordered her ladies to admit Dorothy, and the girl ran
to the queen, who had half arisen in her bed.</p>
<p>"You must have affairs of great moment, indeed," cried
Elizabeth, testily, "if they induce you to disturb me in this
manner."</p>
<p>"Of great moment, indeed, your Majesty," replied Dorothy,
endeavoring to be calm, "of moment to you and to me. Mary Stuart is
in England at this instant trying to steal your crown and my lover.
She is now sleeping within five leagues of this place. God only
knows what she is doing. Let us waste no time, your Majesty."</p>
<p>The girl was growing wilder every second.</p>
<p>"Let us go&mdash;you and I&mdash;and seize this wanton creature.
You to save your crown; I to save my lover and&mdash;my life."</p>
<p>"Where is she?" demanded Elizabeth, sharply. "Cease prattling
about your lover. She would steal both my lover and my crown if she
could. Where is she?"</p>
<p>"She is at Rutland Castle, your Majesty," answered Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Ah, the Duke of Rutland and his son John," said Elizabeth. "I
have been warned of them. Send for my Lord Cecil and Sir William
St. Loe."</p>
<p>Sir William was in command of the yeoman guards.</p>
<p>"Is Sir John Manners your lover?" asked Elizabeth, turning to
Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Yes," answered the girl.</p>
<p>"You may soon seek another," replied the queen,
significantly.</p>
<p>Her Majesty's words seemed to awaken Dorothy from her stupor of
frenzy, and she foresaw the result of her act. Then came upon her a
reaction worse than death.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>You may depart," said the
queen to Dorothy, and the girl went back to her room hardly
conscious that she was moving.</p>
<p>At times we cannot help feeling that love came to the human
breast through a drop of venom shot from the serpent's tongue into
the heart of Eve. Again we believe it to be a spark from God's own
soul. Who will solve me this riddle?</p>
<p>Soon the hard, cold ringing of arms, and the tramp of mailed
feet resounded through Haddon Hall, and the doom-like din reached
Dorothy's room in the tones of a clanging knell. There seemed to be
a frightful rhythm in the chaos of sounds which repeated over and
over again the words: "John will die, John will die," though the
full import of her act and its results did nor for a little time
entirely penetrate her consciousness. She remembered the queen's
words, "You may soon seek another." Elizabeth plainly meant that
John was a traitor, and that John would die for his treason. The
clanking words, "John will die, John will die," bore upon the
girl's ears in ever increasing volume until the agony she suffered
deadened her power to think. She wandered aimlessly about the room,
trying to collect her senses, but her mind was a blank. After a few
minutes she ran back to the queen, having an undefined purpose of
doing something to avert the consequences of her mad act. She at
first thought to tell the queen that the Information she had given
concerning Mary Stuart's presence in Rutland was false, but she
well knew that a lie seldom succeeds; and in this case, even
through her clouded mentality, she could see that a lie would
surely fail. She determined to beg the queen to spare John's life.
She did not know exactly what she would do, but she hoped by the
time she should reach the queen's room to hit upon some plan that
would save him. When she knocked at Elizabeth's door it was locked
against her. Her Majesty <a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>was
in consultation with Cecil, Sir William St. Loe, and a few other
gentlemen, among whom was Sir George Vernon.</p>
<p>Dorothy well knew there was no help for John if her father were
of the queen's council. She insisted upon seeing the queen, but was
rudely repulsed. By the time she again reached her room full
consciousness had returned, and agony such as she had never before
dreamed of overwhelmed her soul. Many of us have felt the same sort
of pain when awakened suddenly to the fact that words we have
spoken easily may not, by our utmost efforts, be recalled, though
we would gladly give our life itself to have them back. If
suffering can atone for sin, Dorothy bought her indulgence within
one hour after sinning. But suffering cannot atone for sin; it is
only a part of it&mdash;the result.</p>
<p>"Arise, Madge, and dress," said Dorothy, gently. "I have made a
terrible mistake. I have committed a frightful crime. I have
betrayed John to death. Ah, help me, Madge, if you can. Pray God to
help me. He will listen to you. I fear to pray to Him. He would
turn my prayers to curses. I am lost." She fell for a moment upon
the bed and placed her head on Madge's breast murmuring, "If I
could but die."</p>
<p>"All may turn out better than it now appears," said Madge.
"Quiet yourself and let us consider what may be done to arrest the
evil of your&mdash;your act."</p>
<p>"Nothing can be done, nothing," wailed Dorothy, as she arose
from the bed and began to dress. "Please arise, Madge, and dress
yourself. Here are your garments and your gown."</p>
<p>They hastily dressed without speaking, and Dorothy began again
to pace the floor.</p>
<p>"He will die hating me," said Dorothy. "If he could live I
willingly would give him to the&mdash;the Scottish <a name=
"Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>woman. Then I could die and my
suffering would cease. I must have been mad when I went to the
queen. He trusted me with his honor and his life, and I, traitress
that I am, have betrayed both. Ah, well, when he dies I also shall
die. There is comfort at least in that thought. How helpless I
am."</p>
<p>She could not weep. It seemed as if there were not a tear in
her. All was hard, dry, burning agony. She again fell upon the bed
and moaned piteously for a little time, wringing her hands and
uttering frantic ejaculatory prayers for help.</p>
<p>"My mind seems to have forsaken me," she said hoarsely to Madge.
"I cannot think. What noise is that?"</p>
<p>She paused and listened for a moment. Then she went to the north
window and opened the casement.</p>
<p>"The yeoman guards from Bakewell are coming," she said. "I
recognize them by the light of their flambeaux. They are entering
the gate at the dove-cote."</p>
<p>A part of the queen's guard had been quartered in the village of
Bakewell.</p>
<p>Dorothy stood at the window for a moment and said: "The other
guards are here under our window and are ready to march to Rutland.
There is Lord Cecil, and Sir William St. Loe, and Malcolm, and
there is my father. Now they are off to meet the other yeomen at
the dove-cote. The stable boys are lighting their torches and
flambeaux. They are going to murder John, and I have sent
them."</p>
<p>Dorothy covered her face with her hands and slowly walked to and
fro across the room.</p>
<p>"Call Malcolm," said Madge. "Perhaps he can help us. Lead me to
the window, Dorothy, and I will call him." Dorothy led Madge to the
window, and above the din of arms I heard her soft voice calling,
"Malcolm, Malcolm."</p>
<p><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>The order to march had been
given before Madge called, but I sought Sir William and told him I
would return to the Hall to get another sword and would soon
overtake him on the road to Rutland.</p>
<p>I then hastened to Dorothy's room. I was ignorant of the means
whereby Elizabeth had learned of Mary's presence at Rutland. The
queen had told no one how the information reached her. The fact
that Mary was in England was all sufficient for Cecil, and he
proceeded to execute the order Elizabeth had given for Mary's
arrest, without asking or desiring any explanation. I, of course,
was in great distress for John's sake, since I knew that he would
be attainted of treason. I had sought in vain some plan whereby I
might help him, but found none. I, myself, being a Scottish
refugee, occupied no safe position, and my slightest act toward
helping John or Mary would be construed against me.</p>
<p>When I entered Dorothy's room, she ran to me and said: "Can you
help me, Malcolm? Can you help me save him from this terrible evil
which I have brought upon him?"</p>
<p>"How did you bring the evil upon him?" I asked, in astonishment.
"It was not your fault that he brought Mary Stuart to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no," she answered; "but I told the queen she was at
Rutland."</p>
<p>"You told the queen?" I exclaimed, unwilling to believe my ears.
"You told&mdash;How&mdash;why&mdash;why did you tell her?"</p>
<p>"I do not know why I told her," she replied. "I was mad
with&mdash;with jealousy. You warned me against it, but I did not
heed you. Jennie Faxton told me that she saw John and&mdash;but all
that does not matter now. I will tell you hereafter if I live. What
we must now do is to save him&mdash;to save him if we can. Try to
devise some plan. Think&mdash;think, Malcolm."</p>
<p><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>My first thought was to
ride to Rutland Castle and give the alarm. Sir George would lead
the yeomen thither by the shortest route&mdash;the road by way of
Rowsley. There was another route leading up the Lathkil through the
dale, and thence by a road turning southward to Rutland. That road
was longer by a league than the one Sir George would take, but I
could put my horse to his greatest speed, and I might be able to
reach the castle in time to enable John and Mary to escape. I
considered the question a moment. My own life certainly would pay
the forfeit in case of failure; but my love for John and, I confess
it with shame, the memory of my old tenderness for Mary impelled me
to take the risk. I explained the plan upon which I was thinking,
and told them of my determination. When I did so, Madge grasped me
by the arm to detain me, and Dorothy fell upon her knees and kissed
my hand.</p>
<p>I said, "I must start at once; for, ride as I may, I fear the
yeomen will reach Rutland gates before I can get there."</p>
<p>"But If the guards should be at the gates when you arrive, or if
you should be missed by Cecil, you, a Scottish refugee and a friend
of Queen Mary, would be suspected of treason, and you would lose
your life," said Madge, who was filled with alarm for my sake.</p>
<p>"That is true," I replied; "but I can think of no other way
whereby John can possibly be saved."</p>
<p>Dorothy stood for a moment in deep thought, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I will ride to Rutland by way of Lathkil Dale&mdash;I will ride
in place of you, Malcolm. It is my duty and my privilege to do this
if I can."</p>
<p>I saw the truth of her words, and felt that since Dorothy had
wrought the evil, it was clearly her duty to remedy it if she
could. If she should fail, no evil consequences would fall upon
her. If I should fail, it would cost me my <a name="Page_314" id=
"Page_314"></a>life; and while I desired to save John, still I
wished to save myself. Though my conduct may not have been
chivalric, still I was willing that Dorothy should go in my place,
and I told her so. I offered to ride with her as far as a certain
cross-road a league distant from Rutland Castle. There I would
leave her, and go across the country to meet the yeomen on the road
they had taken. I could join them before they reached Rutland, and
my absence during the earlier portion of the march would not be
remarked, or if noticed it could easily be explained.</p>
<p>This plan was agreed upon, and after the guards had passed out
at Dove-cote Gate and were well down toward Rowsley, I rode out
from the Hall, and waited for Dorothy at an appointed spot near
Overhaddon.</p>
<p>Immediately after my departure Dolcy was saddled, and soon
Dorothy rode furiously up to me. Away we sped, Dorothy and I, by
Yulegrave church, down into the dale, and up the river. Never shall
I forget that mad ride. Heavy rains had recently fallen, and the
road in places was almost impassable. The rivers were in flood, but
when Dorothy and I reached the ford, the girl did not stop to
consider the danger ahead of her. I heard her whisper, "On, Dolcy,
on," and I heard the sharp "whisp" of the whip as she struck the
trembling, fearful mare, and urged her into the dark flood. Dolcy
hesitated, but Dorothy struck her again and again with the whip and
softly cried, "On, Dolcy, on." Then mare and rider plunged into the
swollen river, and I, of course, followed them. The water was so
deep that our horses were compelled to swim, and when we reached
the opposite side of the river we had drifted with the current a
distance of at least three hundred yards below the road. We climbed
the cliff by a sheep path. How Dorothy did it I do not know; and
how I succeeded in following her I know even less. When we reached
the top of the cliff, Dorothy started off at full <a name=
"Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>gallop, leading the way, and again I
followed. The sheep path leading up the river to the road followed
close the edge of the cliff, where a false step by the horse would
mean death to both horse and rider. But Dorothy feared not, or knew
not, the danger, and I caught her ever whispered cry,&mdash;"On,
Dolcy, on; on, Dolcy, on." Ashamed to fall behind, yet fearing to
ride at such a pace on such a path, I urged my horse forward. He
was a fine, strong, mettlesome brute, and I succeeded in keeping
the girl's dim form in sight. The moon, which was rapidly sinking
westward, still gave us light through rifts in the black bank of
floating clouds, else that ride over the sheep path by the cliff
would have been our last journey in the flesh.</p>
<p>Soon we reached the main road turning southward. It was a series
of rough rocks and mudholes, and Dorothy and Dolcy shot forward
upon it with the speed of the tempest, to undo, if possible, the
evil which a dozen words, untimely spoken, had wrought. I urged my
horse until his head was close by Dolcy's tail, and ever and anon
could I hear the whispered cry,&mdash;"On, Dolcy, on; on, Dolcy,
sweet Dolcy, good Dolcy; on, my pet, on."</p>
<p>No word was spoken between Dorothy and me; but I could hear
Dolcy panting with her mighty effort, and amid the noise of
splashing water and the thud, thud, thud of our horses' hoofs came
always back to me from Dorothy's lips the sad, sad cry, full of
agony and longing,&mdash;"On, Dolcy, on; on Dolcy, on."</p>
<p>The road we took led us over steep hills and down through dark,
shadow-crowded ravines; but up hill, down hill, and on the level
the terrible girl before me plunged forward with unabated headlong
fury until I thought surely the flesh of horse, man, and woman
could endure the strain not one moment longer. But the horses, the
woman, and&mdash;though I say it who should not&mdash;the man were
of God's best handiwork, and the cords of our lives did not
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>snap. One thought, and only
one, held possession of the girl, and the matter of her own life or
death had no place in her mind.</p>
<p>When we reached the cross-road where I was to leave her, we
halted while I instructed Dorothy concerning the road she should
follow from that point to Rutland, and directed her how to proceed
when she should arrive at the castle gate. She eagerly listened for
a moment or two, then grew impatient, and told me to hasten in my
speech, since there was no time to lose. Then she fearlessly dashed
away alone into the black night; and as I watched her fair form
fade into the shadows, the haunting cry came faintly back to
me,&mdash;"On, Dolcy, on; on, Dolcy on," and I was sick at heart. I
was loath to leave her thus in the inky gloom. The moon had sunk
for the night, and the clouds had banked up without a rift against
the hidden stars; but I could give her no further help, and my life
would pay the forfeit should I accompany her. She had brought the
evil upon herself. She was the iron, the seed, the cloud, and the
rain. She was fulfilling her destiny. She was doing that which she
must do: nothing more, nothing less. She was filling her little
niche in the universal moment. She was a part of the infinite
kaleidoscope&mdash;a fate-charged, fate-moved, fragile piece of
glass which might be crushed to atoms in the twinkling of an eye,
in the sounding of a trump.</p>
<p>After leaving Dorothy I rode across the country and soon
overtook the yeoman guard whom I joined unobserved. Then I marched
with them, all too rapidly to suit me, to Rutland. The little army
had travelled with greater speed than I had expected, and I soon
began to fear that Dorothy would not reach Rutland Castle in time
to enable its inmates to escape.</p>
<p>Within half an hour from the time I joined the yeomen we saw the
dim outlines of the castle, and Sir William<a name="Page_317" id=
"Page_317"></a> St. Loe gave the command to hurry forward. Cecil,
Sir William, Sir George, and myself rode in advance of the column.
As we approached the castle by the road leading directly to the
gate from the north, I saw for a moment upon the top of the hill
west of the castle gate the forms of Dorothy and Dolcy in dim
silhouette against the sky. Then I saw them plunge madly down the
hill toward the gate. I fancied I could hear the girl whispering in
frenzied hoarseness,&mdash;"On, Dolcy, on," and I thought I could
catch the panting of the mare. At the foot of the hill, less than
one hundred yards from the gate, poor Dolcy, unable to take another
step, dropped to the ground. Dolcy had gone on to her death. She
had filled her little niche in the universe and had died at her
post Dorothy plunged forward over the mare's head, and a cry of
alarm came from my lips despite me. I was sure the girl had been
killed. She, however, instantly sprang to her feet. Her hair was
flying behind her and she ran toward the gate crying: "John, John,
fly for your life!" And then she fell prone upon the ground and did
not rise.</p>
<p>We had all seen the mare fall, and had seen the girl run forward
toward the gates and fall before reaching them. Cecil and Sir
William rode to the spot where Dorothy lay, and dismounted.</p>
<p>In a moment Sir William called to Sir George:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The lady is your daughter, Mistress Dorothy."</p>
<p>"What in hell's name brings her here?" cried Sir George,
hurriedly riding forward, "and how came she?"</p>
<p>I followed speedily, and the piteous sight filled my eyes with
tears. I cannot describe it adequately to you, though I shall see
it vividly to the end of my days. Dorothy had received a slight
wound upon the temple, and blood was trickling down her face upon
her neck and ruff. Her hair had fallen from its fastenings. She had
lost her hat, and her gown was torn in shreds and covered with
mud.<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a> I lifted the
half-conscious girl to her feet and supported her; then with my
kerchief I bound up the wound upon her temple.</p>
<p>"Poor Dolcy," she said, almost incoherently, "I have killed her
and I have failed&mdash;I have failed. Now I am ready to die. Would
that I had died with Dolcy. Let me lie down here,
Malcolm,&mdash;let me lie down."</p>
<p>I still held her in my arms and supported her half-fainting
form.</p>
<p>"Why are you here?" demanded Sir George.</p>
<p>"To die," responded Dorothy.</p>
<p>"To die? Damned nonsense!" returned her father.</p>
<p>"How came you here, you fool?"</p>
<p>"On Dolcy. She is dead," returned Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Were you not at Haddon when we left there?" asked her
father.</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>
<p>"Did you pass us on the road?" he asked.</p>
<p>"How came you here?" Sir George insisted.</p>
<p>"Oh, I flew hither. I am a witch. Don't question me, father. I
am in no temper to listen to you. I warn you once and for all, keep
away from me; beware of me. I have a dagger in my bosom. Go and do
the work you came to do; but remember this, father, if harm comes
to him I will take my own life, and my blood shall be upon your
soul."</p>
<p>"My God, Malcolm, what does she mean?" asked Sir George, touched
with fear by the strength of his daughter's threat. "Has she lost
her wits?"</p>
<p>"No," the girl quickly responded, "I have only just found
them."</p>
<p>Sir George continued to question Dorothy, but he received no
further response from her. She simply held up the palm of her hand
warningly toward him, and the ges<a name="Page_319" id=
"Page_319"></a>ture was as eloquent as an oration. She leaned
against me, and covered her face with her hands, while her form
shook and trembled as if with a palsy.</p>
<p>Cecil and Sir William St. Loe then went toward the gate, and Sir
George said to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I must go with them. You remain with Doll, and see that she is
taken home. Procure a horse for her. If she is unable to ride, make
a litter, or perhaps there is a coach in the castle; if so, take
possession of it. Take her home by some means when we return. What,
think you, could have brought her here?"</p>
<p>I evaded the question by replying, "I will probably be able to
get a coach in the castle, Sir George. Leave Dorothy with me."</p>
<p>Soon, by the command of Sir William, the yeomen rode to the
right and to the left for the purpose of surrounding the castle,
and then I heard Cecil at the gates demanding:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Open in the name of the queen."</p>
<p>"Let us go to the gates," said Dorothy, "that we may hear what
they say and see what they do. Will they kill him here, think you?"
she asked, looking wildly into my face.</p>
<p>The flambeaux on the castle gate and those which the link-boys
had brought with them from Haddon were lighted, and the scene in
front of the gate was all aglow.</p>
<p>"No, no, my sweet one," I answered, "perhaps they will not kill
him at all. Certainly they will not kill him now. They must try him
first."</p>
<p>I tried to dissuade her from going to the gates, but she
insisted, and I helped her to walk forward.</p>
<p>When Dorothy and I reached the gates, we found that Cecil and
Lord Rutland were holding a consultation through the parley-window.
The portcullis was still down, <a name="Page_320" id=
"Page_320"></a>and the gates were closed; but soon the portcullis
was raised, a postern was opened from within, and Sir William
entered the castle with two score of the yeomen guards.</p>
<p>Sir George approached and again plied Dorothy with questions,
but she would not speak. One would have thought from her attitude
that she was deaf and dumb. She seemed unconscious of her father's
presence.</p>
<p>"She has lost her mind," said Sir George, in tones of deep
trouble, "and I know not what to do."</p>
<p>"Leave her with me for a time, cousin. I am sure she will be
better if we do not question her now."</p>
<p>Then Dorothy seemed to awaken. "Malcolm is right, father. Leave
me for a time, I pray you."</p>
<p>Sir George left us, and waited with a party of yeomen a short
distance from the gate for the return of Sir William with his
prisoners.</p>
<p>Dorothy and I sat upon a stone bench, near the postern through
which Sir William and the guardsmen had entered, but neither of us
spoke.</p>
<p>After a long, weary time of waiting Sir William came out of the
castle through the postern, and with him came Mary Stuart. My heart
jumped when I saw her in the glare of the flambeaux, and the spirit
of my dead love for her came begging admission to my heart. I
cannot describe my sensations when I beheld her, but this I knew,
that my love for her was dead past resurrection.</p>
<p>Following Mary came Lord Rutland, and immediately following his
Lordship walked John. When he stepped through the postern, Dorothy
sprang to her feet and ran to him with a cry, "John, John!"</p>
<p>He looked at her in surprise, and stepped toward her with
evident intent to embrace her. His act was probably the result of
an involuntary impulse, for he stopped before he reached the
girl.</p>
<p><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>Sir George had gone at Sir
William's request to arrange the guards for the return march.</p>
<p>Dorothy and John were standing within two yards of each
other.</p>
<p>"Do not touch me," cried Dorothy, "save to strike me If you
will. The evil which has come upon you is of my doing. I betrayed
you to the queen."</p>
<p>I saw Mary turn quickly toward the girl when she uttered those
words.</p>
<p>"I was insane when I did it," continued Dorothy. "They will take
your life, John. But when you die I also shall die. It is a poor
reparation, I know, but it is the only one I can make."</p>
<p>"I do not understand you, Dorothy," said John. "Why should you
betray me?"</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you," she answered. "All I know is that I did
betray you and I hardly know how I did it. It all seems like a
dream&mdash;like a fearful monster of the night. There is no need
for me to explain. I betrayed you and now I suffer for it, more a
thousand-fold than you can possibly suffer. I offer no excuse. I
have none. I simply betrayed you, and ask only that I may die with
you."</p>
<p>Then was manifest in John's heart the noblest quality which God
has given to man-charity, strengthened by reason. His face glowed
with a light that seemed saintlike, and a grand look of ineffable
love and pity came to his eyes. He seemed as if by inspiration to
understand all that Dorothy had felt and done, and he knew that if
she had betrayed him she had done it at a time when she was not
responsible for her acts. He stepped quickly to the girl's side,
and caring naught that we all should see him, caught her to his
breast. He held her in his arms, and the light of the flambeaux
fell upon her upturned face.</p>
<p>"Dorothy," he said, "it matters not what you have done; you are
my only love. I ask no explanation. If <a name="Page_322" id=
"Page_322"></a>you have betrayed me to death, though I hope it will
not come to that evil, you did not do it because you did not love
me."</p>
<p>"No, no, John, you know that," sobbed the girl.</p>
<p>"I do know it, Dorothy; I know all that I wish to know. You
would not intentionally bring evil upon me while you love me."</p>
<p>"Ah, that I do, John; only God knows how deeply, how
desperately. My love was the cause&mdash;my love was my
curse&mdash;it was your curse."</p>
<p>"Do not weep, Dorothy," said John, interrupting her. "I would
that I could take all your suffering upon myself. Do not weep."</p>
<p>Dorothy buried her face upon his breast and tears came to her
relief. She was not alone in her weeping, for there stood I like a
very woman, and by my side stood rough old Sir William. Tears were
coursing down the bronzed cheek of the grand old warrior like drops
of glistening dew upon the harrowed face of a mountain rock. When I
saw Sir William's tears, I could no longer restrain my emotions,
and I frankly tell you that I made a spectacle of myself in full
view of the queen's yeoman guard.</p>
<p>Sir George approached our little group, and when he saw Dorothy
in John's arms, he broke forth into oaths and stepped toward her
intending to force her away. But John held up the palm of his free
hand warningly toward Sir George, and drawing the girl's drooping
form close to his breast he spoke calmly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Old man, if you but lay a finger on this girl, I will kill you
where you stand. No power on earth can save you."</p>
<p>There was a tone in John's voice that forced even Sir George to
pause. Then Sir George turned to me.</p>
<p>"This is the man who was in my house. He is the man who called
himself Thomas. Do you know him?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a>Dorothy saved me from the
humiliation of an answer.</p>
<p>She took one step from John's side and held him by the hand
while she spoke.</p>
<p>"Father," she said, "this man is Sir John Manners. Now you may
understand why he could not seek my hand openly, and you also know
why I could not tell you his name." She again turned to John, and
he put his arm about her. You can imagine much better that I can
describe Sir George's fury. He snatched a halberd from the hands of
a yeoman who was standing near by and started toward John and
Dorothy. Thereupon the hard old warrior, Sir William St. Loe, whose
heart one would surely say was the last place where sentiment could
dwell, performed a little act of virtue which will balance many a
page on the debtor side of his ledger of life, he lifted his sword
and scabbard and struck Sir George's outstretched hand, causing the
halberd to fall to the ground.</p>
<p>"Don't touch the girl," cried Sir William, hoarsely.</p>
<p>"She is my daughter," retorted Sir George, who was stunned
mentally as well as physically by Sir William's blow.</p>
<p>"I care not whose daughter she is," returned Sir William. "You
shall not touch her. If you make but one other attempt, I will use
my blade upon you."</p>
<p>Sir William and John had been warm friends at London court, and
the old captain of the guards quickly guessed the true situation
when he saw Dorothy run to John's arms.</p>
<p>"Sir, you shall answer for this," said Sir George, angrily, to
Sir William.</p>
<p>"With pleasure," returned Sir William. "I will give you
satisfaction whenever you wish it, save this present time. I am too
busy now."</p>
<p>Blessed old Sir William! You have been dead these many winters;
and were I a priest, I would say a mass for your soul gratis every
day in the year.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>Did the girl betray us?"
asked Queen Mary.</p>
<p>No one answered her question. Then she turned toward Sir John
and touched him upon the shoulder. He turned his face toward her,
signifying that he was listening.</p>
<p>"Who is this girl?" Mary demanded.</p>
<p>"My sweetheart, my affianced wife," John answered.</p>
<p>"She says she betrayed us," the queen responded.</p>
<p>"Yes," said John.</p>
<p>"Did you trust her with knowledge of our presence in Rutland?"
Mary demanded angrily.</p>
<p>"I did," he answered.</p>
<p>"You were a fool," said Mary.</p>
<p>"I know it," responded John.</p>
<p>"You certainly bear her no resentment for her treason," said
Mary.</p>
<p>"I certainly do not," quietly answered John. "Her suffering is
greater than mine. Can you not see that it is?"</p>
<p>"It is your privilege," said Mary, scornfully, "to intrust your
own secrets to whomsoever you may choose for your confidant, and it
is quite saintlike in you to forgive this person for betraying you;
but what think you of the hard case in which her treason and your
folly have placed me?"</p>
<p>"That is my greatest grief, save for Dorothy," answered John,
softly. Lived there ever a man possessed of broader charity or
deeper love than John? God surely made him of gold dust, not of
common clay.</p>
<p>Queen Mary stepped away from John in disgust, and when she
turned she saw me for the first time. She started and was about to
speak, but I placed my fingers warningly upon my lips and she
remained silent.</p>
<p>"Where do you take us, Sir William?" asked John.</p>
<p>"To Haddon Hall. There you will await the commands of the
queen."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>How came you here?" John
asked gently of Dorothy.</p>
<p>"I rode Dolcy," she whispered. "She dropped dead at the foot of
the hill. Yonder she lies. I came up the Lathkil by the long road,
and I hoped that I might reach you in time to give warning. When
the guard left Haddon I realized the evil that would come upon you
by reason of my base betrayal." Here she broke down and for a
moment could not proceed in the narrative. She soon recovered and
continued: "Then I mounted Dolcy, and tried to reach here by way of
the long road. Poor Dolcy seemed to understand my trouble and my
despair, and she brought me with all the speed that a horse could
make; but the road was too long and too rough; and she failed, and
I failed. Would that I could have died in her place. She gave her
life in trying to remedy my fault."</p>
<p>Dorothy again began to weep, and John tenderly
whispered:&mdash;</p>
<p>"All will yet come right" Then he kissed her before us all, and
handed her to me saying, "Care for her, I pray you, sir."</p>
<p>John spoke a few words to Sir William, and in a moment they both
went back to the castle.</p>
<p>In a short time the gates were opened, and the Rutland coach
drawn by four horses emerged from the castle grounds. Sir William
then directed Mary and Dorothy to enter the coach and requested me
to ride with them to Haddon Hall.</p>
<p>The yeoman guards were in marching order, and I took my seat in
the coach. The fates surely were in a humorous mood when they threw
Dorothy, Queen Mary, and myself together. Pause for a moment and
consider the situation. You know all the facts and you can analyze
it as well as I. I could not help laughing at the fantastic trick
of destiny.</p>
<p>Soon after I entered the coach Sir William gave the <a name=
"Page_326" id="Page_326"></a>word, and the yeomen with Lord Rutland
and John moved forward on the road to Haddon.</p>
<p>The coach at once followed the guard and a score of yeomen
followed us.</p>
<p>Queen Mary occupied the back seat of the coach, and Dorothy and
I sat upon the front seat facing her.</p>
<p>Dorothy was exhausted, and her head lay upon my shoulder. Now
and again she would softly moan and sob, but she said nothing.
After a few minutes of silence Queen Mary spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Why did you betray me, you miserable wretch? Why did you betray
me?"</p>
<p>Dorothy did not answer. Mary continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Have I ever injured you in any manner? Have I ever harmed you
by thought, word, or deed?"</p>
<p>Dorothy's only answer was a sob.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you are a canting fanatic, and it may be that you hate
me for the sake of that which you call the love of God?"</p>
<p>"No, no, madam," I said, "that was not the reason."</p>
<p>"Do you know the reason, Malcolm?" asked Mary, addressing me for
the first time. My name upon her lips had a strange effect on me.
It was like the wafting to my nostrils of a sweet forgotten odor,
or the falling upon my ears of a tender refrain of bygone days. Her
voice in uttering my name thrilled me, and I hated myself for my
weakness.</p>
<p>I told Mary that I did not know Dorothy's reasons, and she
continued:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Malcolm, you were not a party to my betrayal for the sake of
revenging yourself on me?"</p>
<p>"God forbid!" I answered. "Sir John Manners will assure you of
my innocence. I rode with Mistress Vernon to a cross-road within a
league of Rutland, hoping thereby to assist her to give you and Sir
John the alarm."</p>
<p><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a>My admission soon brought
me into trouble.</p>
<p>"I alone am to blame," said Dorothy, faintly.</p>
<p>"I can easily believe you," said Mary, sharply. "Did you expect
to injure me?"</p>
<p>No answer came from Dorothy.</p>
<p>"If you expect to injure me," Mary continued, "you will be
disappointed. I am a queen, and my Cousin Elizabeth would not dare
to harm me, even though she might wish to do so. We are of the same
blood, and she will not wish to do me injury. Your doting lover
will probably lose his head for bringing me to England without his
queen's consent. He is her subject. I am not. I wish you joy of the
trouble you have brought upon him and upon yourself."</p>
<p>"Upon him!" cried Dorothy.</p>
<p>"Yes, upon him," continued Mary, relishing the torture she was
inflicting. "You will enjoy seeing him beheaded, will you not, you
fool, you huzzy, you wretch? I hope his death will haunt you till
the end of your days."</p>
<p>Poor Dorothy, leaning against me, said faintly:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It will&mdash;it will. You&mdash;you devil."</p>
<p>The girl was almost dead from exhaustion and anguish, but she
would have been dead indeed had she lacked the power to strike
back. I believe had it not been for Dorothy's physical weakness she
would have silenced Mary with her hands.</p>
<p>After a little time Dorothy's heavy breathing indicated that she
had fallen asleep. Her head rested upon my shoulder, and the
delicious perfume of her hair and the sweet warm breath from her
lips were almost intoxicating even to me, though I was not in love
with her. How great must their effect have been coming upon John
hot from her intense young soul!</p>
<p>As the link-boys passed the coach some and some with their
flambeaux I could see Dorothy's sweet pale face, <a name="Page_328"
id="Page_328"></a>almost hidden in the tangled golden red hair
which fell in floods about her. The perfect oval of her cheek, the
long wet lashes, the arched eyebrows, the low broad forehead, the
straight nose, the saucy chin&mdash;all presented a picture of
beauty and pathos sufficient to soften a heart of stone. Mary had
no heart of any sort, therefore she was not moved to pity. That
emotion, I am sure, she never felt from the first to the last day
of her life. She continued to probe Dorothy's wound until I told
her the girl was asleep. I changed Dorothy's position and placed
her head against the corner cushion of the coach that she might
rest more comfortably. She did not awaken when I moved her. She
slept and looked like a child. For a little time after I had
changed Dorothy's position Mary and I sat in silence. She was the
first to speak. She leaned forward and placing her hands upon mine,
whispered my name:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Malcolm!"</p>
<p>After a brief silence I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"What would you, your Majesty?"</p>
<p>"Not 'your Majesty'" said Mary, softly, "but Mary, as of
old."</p>
<p>She remained for a moment with her hand upon my knee, and then
whispered:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Will you not sit by me, Malcolm?"</p>
<p>I believe that Mary Stuart's voice was the charm wherewith she
fascinated men. I resisted to my utmost strength, but that seemed
to be little more than utter weakness; so I took a seat by her
side, and she gently placed her hand in mine. The warm touch of her
strong, delicate fingers gave me a familiar thrill. She asked me to
tell her of my wanderings since I had left Scotland, and I briefly
related all my adventures. I told her of my home at Haddon Hall and
of the welcome given me by my cousin, Sir George.</p>
<p>"Malcolm, have you forgotten?" she whispered, leaning <a name=
"Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>gently against me. "Have you forgotten
our old-time vows and love? Have you forgotten all that passed
between us in the dear old ch&acirc;teau, when I gave to you my
virgin love, fresh from my virgin heart?" I sighed and tried to
harden my heart to her blandishments, for I knew she wished to use
me and was tempting me to that end. She continued, "I was then only
fourteen years old&mdash;ten years ago. You said that you loved me
and I believed you. You could not doubt, after the proof I gave to
you, that my heart was all yours. We were happy, oh, so happy. Do
you remember, Malcolm?"</p>
<p>She brought her face close to mine while she spoke, and pressed
my hand upon her breast.</p>
<p>My reason told me that it was but the song of the siren she was
singing to my ears. My memory told me that she had been false to me
twice two score times, and I knew full well she would again be
false to me, or to any other man whom she could use for her
purposes, and that she cared not the price at which she purchased
him. Bear in mind, you who would blame me for my fall, that this
woman not only was transcendently beautiful and fatally
fascinating, but she was a queen and had held undisputed sway over
my heart for more years than I could accurately number. As I said,
added to all her beauty, she was a queen. If you have never known
royalty, you cannot understand its enthralling power.</p>
<p>"I remember it all, madam," I replied, trying to hold myself
away from her. "It is fresh to me as if it all had happened
yesterday." The queen drew my arm closely to her side and nestled
her cheek for an instant upon my shoulder.</p>
<p>"I remember also," I continued, "your marriage with Darnley when
I had your promise that you would marry me; and, shame upon shame,
I remember your marriage with Darnley's murderer, Bothwell."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>Cruel, cruel, Malcolm,"
she said. "You well know the overpowering reasons of state which
impelled me to sacrifice my own happiness by marrying Darnley. I
told you at the time that I hated the marriage more than I dreaded
death. But I longed to quiet the factions in Scotland, and I hoped
to save my poor bleeding people from the evils of war. You know I
hated Darnley. You know I loved you. You knew then and you know now
that you are the only man who has ever possessed my heart. You know
that my words are true. You know that you, alone, have had my love
since the time when I was a child."</p>
<p>"And Rizzio?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, Malcolm," she answered tearfully, "I hope you, of all men,
do not believe that I ever gave a thought of love to Rizzio. He was
to me like my pet monkey or my favorite falcon. He was a beautiful,
gentle, harmless soul. I loved him for his music. He worshipped me
as did my spaniel."</p>
<p>Still I was determined that her blandishments should not move
me.</p>
<p>"And Bothwell?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That is past endurance from you, Malcolm," she said, beginning
to weep. "You know I was brutally abducted and was forced into
marriage with him. He was an outlaw, an outcast. He was an uncouth
brute whom any woman would loathe. I was in his power, and I
feigned acquiescence only that I might escape and achieve vengeance
upon him. Tell me, Malcolm, tell me," continued Mary, placing her
arms about my neck and clinging to me, "tell me, you, to whom I
gave my maiden's love, you who have my woman's heart, tell me, do
you believe that I could willingly have married Bothwell, even
though my heart had not been filled with the image of you, who are
strong, gentle, and beautiful?"</p>
<p><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a>You, if you are a man, may
think that in my place you would have resisted the attack of this
beautiful queen, but if so you think&mdash;pardon me, my
friend&mdash;you are a fool. Under the spell of her magic influence
I wavered in the conviction which had long since come upon me, that
I had for years been her fool and her dupe. I forgot the former
lessons I had learned from her perfidy. I forgot my manhood. I
forgot all of good that had of late grown up in me. God help me, I
forgot even Madge.</p>
<p>"If I could only believe you, Mary," I answered, growing insane
under the influence of her fascinations, "If I could only believe
you."</p>
<p>"Give me your lips, Malcolm," she whispered, "give me your
lips.&mdash;Again, my Malcolm.&mdash;Ah, now you believe me."</p>
<p>The lying logic of a wanton kiss is irresistible. I was drunk
and, alas! I was convinced. When I think of that time, Samson is my
only comfort&mdash;Samson and a few hundred million other fools,
who like Samson and me have been wheedled, kissed, and duped into
misery and ruin.</p>
<p>I said: "I do believe you, Mary. I beg you to forgive me for
having doubted you. You have been traduced and brutally
misused."</p>
<p>"It is sweet to hear you speak those words. But it is better to
think that at last we have come together with nothing to part us
save that I am a prisoner in the hands of my vindictive, jealous
cousin. I thank God that my kingdom of Scotland has been taken from
me. I ever hated the Scots. They are an ignorant, unkempt,
wry-necked, stubborn, filthy race. But, above all, my crown stood
between you and me. I may now be a woman, and were it not for
Elizabeth, you and I could yet find solace in each other for all
our past sufferings. Malcolm, I have a sweet thought. If I could
escape to fair, beautiful France, all would be happiness for us.
You could claim your mother's estates in the balmy south, and we
might <a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a>live upon them. Help me,
my Malcolm, to escape, and your reward shall be greater and sweeter
than man ever before received from woman."</p>
<p>I struggled against her blandishments for a moment, but I was
lost.</p>
<p>"You shall escape and I will go with you," said I. Man needs to
make but one little prayer to God, "Lead me not into temptation."
That prayer answered, all else of good will follow.</p>
<p>The morning sun had just begun to rise over Bowling Green Hill
and the shadows of the night were fleeing before his lances, when
our cavalcade entered the grounds of Haddon at the dove-cote. If
there were two suns revolving about the earth, one to shine upon us
by night and one by day, much evil would be averted. Men do evil in
the dark because others cannot see them; they think evil in the
dark because they cannot see themselves.</p>
<p>With the first faint gray of dawn there came to me thoughts of
Madge. I had forgotten her, but her familiar spirit, the light,
brought me back to its fair mistress.</p>
<p>When our coach reached the stone bridge I looked up to the Hall
and saw Madge standing at the open casement of the tower window.
She had been watching there all night, I learned, hoping for our
speedy and safe return, and had been warned of our approach by the
noise of the tramping guard. I drew back from the coach window,
feeling that I was an evil shade slinking away before the spirit of
light.</p>

"Page_333"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h2>LIGHT</h2>
<p>Dorothy had awakened while we were entering Rowsley, and I was
glad that Mary could not touch me again.</p>
<p>When our coach reached the stone steps of the entrance tower we
found Sir George, Lady Crawford, and Madge waiting to receive us.
The steps and the path leading to them had been carpeted with soft
rugs, and Mary, although a prisoner, was received with ceremonies
befitting her rank. It was a proud day for Sir George when the roof
of his beautiful Hall sheltered the two most famous queens of
christendom.</p>
<p>Sir George assisted Mary from the coach most graciously, and in
knightly fashion led her to Lady Crawford and Madge, who were
standing at the foot of the tower steps. Due presentations were
made, and the ladies of Haddon having kissed the queen's hand, Mary
went into the Hall upon the arm of his Majesty, the King of the
Peak, who stepped forward most proudly.</p>
<p>His resentment against Dorothy was for the moment neutralized by
the great honor of which his house and himself were the
recipients.</p>
<p>John and Lord Rutland were taken to the dungeon.</p>
<p>I assisted Dorothy from the coach and led her to Madge, who was
waiting for us upon the lowest of the steps leading to the entrance
tower doorway. Dorothy took Madge's <a name="Page_334" id=
"Page_334"></a>outstretched hand; but Madge, by some strange
instinct, knowing of my presence, turned her face toward me. I
could not lift my eyes to her face, nor could I endure to remain in
her presence. While we were ascending the steps she held out her
hand to me and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Is all well with you, Malcolm?" Her voice was full of tender
concern, and it pained me to the heart to hear her speak kindly to
me, who was so unworthy of her smallest thought.</p>
<p>"Yes, Lady&mdash;yes, Madge," I responded; but she knew from the
tones of my voice that all was not right with me.</p>
<p>"I fear, Malcolm, that you do not tell me the truth. You will
come to me soon?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I may not be able to go to you soon," I answered, "but I will
do so at the first opportunity."</p>
<p>The torture of her kindness was almost unbearable to me. One
touch of her hand, one tone of her rare voice, had made me loathe
myself. The powers of evil cannot stand for one moment in a fair
conflict with the powers of good. I felt that I, alone, was to
blame for my treason to Madge; but despite my effort at
self-condemnation there was an under-consciousness that Mary Stuart
was to blame, and I hated her accordingly. Although Madge's
presence hurt me, it was not because I wished to conceal my conduct
from her. I knew that I could be happy again only after I had
confessed to her and had received forgiveness.</p>
<p>Madge, who was blind of sight, led Dorothy, who was piteously
blind of soul, and the two girls went to their apartments.</p>
<p>Curiosity is not foreign even to the royal female breast, and
while Mary Stuart was entering Haddon Hall, I saw the luminous head
of the Virgin Queen peeked out at a casement on the second floor
watching her rival with all <a name="Page_335" id=
"Page_335"></a>the curiosity of a Dutch woman sitting by her window
mirror.</p>
<p>I went to my room in Eagle Tower, fell upon my bed, and
abandoned myself to an anguish of soul which was almost luxurious.
I shall not tease you with the details of my mental and moral
processes. I hung in the balance a long time undetermined what
course I should pursue. The difference between the influence of
Mary and the effect wrought by Madge was the difference between the
intoxication and the exhilaration of wine. Following the
intoxication of Mary's presence ever came a torturing reaction,
while the exhilarating influence of Madge gave health and strength.
I chose the latter. I have always been glad I reached that
determination without the aid of any impulse outside of myself; for
events soon happened which again drove all faith in Mary from my
heart forever. Those events would have forced me to abandon my
trust in her; but mind you, I took my good resolve from inclination
rather than necessity before I learned of Mary's perfidy.</p>
<p>The events of the night had exhausted Dorothy, and she was
confined to her bed by illness for the first time in her life. She
believed that she was dying, and she did not want to live. I did
not go to her apartments. Madge remained with her, and I,
coward-like, feared to face the girl to whom I had been untrue.</p>
<p>Dorothy's one and only desire, of course, was to see John, but
that desire for a time seemed impossible of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, Cecil, Leicester, and Sir William St. Loe were in
secret consultation many times during three or four days and
nights. Occasionally Sir George was called into their councils, and
that flattering attention so wrought upon the old man's pride that
he was a slave to the queen's slightest wish, and was more
tyrannical <a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a>and dictatorial
than ever before to all the rest of mankind. There were, however,
two persons besides the queen before whom Sir George was gracious:
one of these was Mary Stuart, whose powers of fascination had been
brought to bear upon the King of the Peak most effectively. The
other was Leicester, to whom, as my cousin expressed it, he hoped
to dispose of that troublesome and disturbing body&mdash;Dorothy.
These influences, together with the fact that his enemies of
Rutland were in the Haddon dungeon, had given Sir George a
spleen-vent, and Dorothy, even in the face of her father's
discovery that Manners was her mysterious lover, had for once a
respite from Sir George's just and mighty wrath.</p>
<p>The purpose of Elizabeth's many councils of war was to devise
some means of obtaining from John and his father, information
concerning the plot, which had resulted in bringing Mary Stuart
into England. The ultimate purpose of Mary's visit, Elizabeth's
counsellors firmly believed to be the dethronement of the English
queen and the enthronement of her Scottish cousin. Elizabeth, in
her heart, felt confident that John and his father were not parties
to the treasonable plot, although she had been warned against each
of them. Cecil and Sir William St. Loe also secretly held to that
opinion, though neither of them expressed it, Elizabeth was
conscious of having given to John while at London court an
intimation that she would be willing that Mary should visit
England. Of such intimation Cecil and Sir William had no knowledge,
though they, together with many persons of the Court, believed that
Elizabeth was not entirely averse to Mary's presence.</p>
<p>Lord Rutland and John were questioned by Cecil in the hope of
obtaining some hints which might lead to the detection of those
concerned in the chief plot, provided such plot existed. But Lord
Rutland knew nothing of the affair <a name="Page_337" id=
"Page_337"></a>except that John had brought the Scottish queen from
Scotland, and John persisted in the statement that he had no
confederate and that he knew nothing of any plot to place Mary upon
the English throne.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a name="v337" id="v337"></a> <img src=
"images/v337.jpg" alt="" title="" /></div>
<p>John said: "I received from Queen Mary's friends in Scotland
letters asking me to meet her on the border, and requesting me to
conduct her to my father's castle. Those letters mentioned no
Englishman but myself, and they stated that Queen Mary's flight to
England was to be undertaken with the tacit consent of our gracious
queen. That fact, the letters told me, our queen wished should not
be known. There were reasons of state, the letters said, which made
it impolitic for our queen openly to invite Queen Mary to seek
sanctuary in England. I received those letters before I left
Westminster. Upon the day when I received them, I heard our
gracious queen say that she would gladly invite Queen Mary to
England, were it not for the fact that such an invitation would
cause trouble between her and the regent, Murray. Her Majesty at
the same time intimated that she would be glad if Mary Stuart
should come to England uninvited." John turned to Elizabeth, "I beg
your Majesty, in justice, to ratify my words." Elizabeth hesitated
for a moment after John's appeal; but her love of justice came to
her rescue and she hung her head as she said, "You are right, Sir
John." Then she looked her counsellors in the face and said, "I
well remember that I so expressed myself."</p>
<p>"In truth," said John, "I having only an hour before received
the letter from Scotland, believed that your Majesty's words were
meant for my ear. I felt that your Majesty knew of the letters, and
I thought that I should be carrying out your royal wishes should I
bring Queen Mary into England without your knowledge."</p>
<p>The queen responded: "I then felt that I wished Queen<a name=
"Page_338" id="Page_338"></a> Mary to seek refuge in my kingdom,
but so many untoward events have transpired since I spoke on the
subject at Westminster that I have good cause to change my mind,
though I easily understand how you might have been misled by my
words."</p>
<p>"I am sure," replied John, "that your Majesty has had good cause
to change your mind; but I protest in all sincerity that I
considered the Scottish letters to be a command from my queen."</p>
<p>Elizabeth was a strange combination of paradoxes. No one could
be truer than she to a fixed determination once taken. No one could
be swayed by doubt so easily as she to change her mind sixty times
in the space of a minute. During one moment she was minded to
liberate John and Lord Rutland; in the next she determined to hold
them in prison, hoping to learn from them some substantial fact
concerning the plot which, since Mary's arrival in England, had
become a nightmare to her. But, with all her vagaries the Virgin
Queen surely loved justice. That quality, alone, makes a sovereign
great. Elizabeth, like her mother, Anne Boleyn, had great faith in
her personal beauty; like her father, she had unbounded confidence
in her powers of mind. She took great pride in the ease with which
she controlled persons. She believed that no one was so adroit as
Elizabeth Tudor in extracting secrets from others, and in
unravelling mysterious situations, nor so cunning in hunting out
plots and in running down plotters. In all such matters she
delighted to act secretly and alone.</p>
<p>During the numerous councils held at Haddon, Elizabeth allowed
Cecil to question John to his heart's content; but while she
listened she formulated a plan of her own which she was sure would
be effective in extracting all the truth from John, if all the
truth had not already been extracted. Elizabeth kept her cherished
plan to herself. It was this:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>She would visit Dorothy,
whom she knew to be ill, and would by her subtle art steal from
John's sweetheart all that the girl knew of the case. If John had
told Dorothy part of the affair concerning Mary Stuart, he had
probably told her all, and Elizabeth felt confident that she could
easily pump the girl dry. She did not know Dorothy. Accordingly our
queen, Elizabeth, the adroit, went to Dorothy's room under the
pretence of paying the girl a gracious visit. Dorothy wished to
arise and receive her royal guest, but Elizabeth said
gently:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Do not arise, Dorothy; rest quietly, and I will sit here beside
you on the bed. I have come to tell you that you must recover your
health at once. We miss you greatly in the Hall."</p>
<p>No one could be more gracious than Elizabeth when the humor was
upon her; though, in truth, the humor was often lacking.</p>
<p>"Let us send all save you and me from the room," said the queen,
"that we may have a quiet little chat together."</p>
<p>All who were in the room save Dorothy and Elizabeth of course
departed at once.</p>
<p>When the door was closed, the queen said: "I wish to thank you
for telling me of the presence of her Scottish Majesty at Rutland.
You know there is a plot on foot to steal my throne from me."</p>
<p>"God forbid that there should be such a plot," replied Dorothy,
resting upon her elbow in the bed.</p>
<p>"I fear it is only too true that there is such a plot," returned
Elizabeth, "and I owe you a great debt of gratitude for warning me
of the Scottish queen's presence in my kingdom."</p>
<p>"I hope the danger will be averted from your Majesty," said
Dorothy; "but that which I did will cause my death&mdash;it will
kill me. No human being ever before has lived <a name="Page_340"
id="Page_340"></a>through the agony I have suffered since that
terrible night. I was a traitress. I betrayed the man who is dearer
to me than my immortal soul. He says that he forgives me, but your
Majesty knows that my fault is beyond forgiveness."</p>
<p>"Sir John is a noble gentleman, child," said the queen. "I hope
that he is loyal to me, but I fear&mdash;I fear."</p>
<p>"Do not doubt, do not fear, my queen," returned Dorothy,
eagerly; "there is nothing false in him."</p>
<p>"Do you love him deeply, little one?" asked the queen.</p>
<p>"No words can tell you my love for him," answered the girl. "I
feel shame to say that he has taken even the holy God's place in my
heart. Perhaps it is for that sin that God now punishes me."</p>
<p>"Fear not on that score, Dorothy," replied the queen. "God will
not punish you for feeling the love which He Himself has put into
your heart. I would willingly give my crown could I feel such love
for a worthy man who would in return love me for myself. But I
cannot feel, nor can I have faith. Self-interest, which is so
dominant in all men, frightens me, and I doubt their vows."</p>
<p>"Surely, any man would love you for your own sake," said
Dorothy, tenderly.</p>
<p>"It may be that you speak truly, child; but I cannot know when
men's vows are true nor when they are false. The real trouble is
within myself. If I could but feel truly, I could interpret
truthfully."</p>
<p>"Ah, your Majesty," interrupted Dorothy, "you do not know the
thing for which you are wishing; it is a torture worse than death;
it is an ecstasy sweeter than heaven. It is killing me. I pity you,
though you are a queen, if you have never felt it."</p>
<p>"Would you do anything I might ask of you, if you could thereby
save Sir John's life?" asked the queen.</p>
<p>"Ah, I would gladly give my soul to save him," responded<a name=
"Page_341" id="Page_341"></a> Dorothy, with tears in her eyes and
eagerness in her voice. "Oh, my queen, do not lead me to hope, and
then plunge me again into despair. Give me no encouragement unless
you mean to free him. As for my part, take my life and spare
John's. Kill me by torture, burn me at the stake, stretch me upon
the rack till my joints are severed and my flesh is torn asunder.
Let me die by inches, my queen; but spare him, oh, spare him, and
do with me as you will. Ask from me what you wish. Gladly will I do
all that you may demand; gladly will I welcome death and call it
sweet, if I can thereby save him. The faint hope your Majesty's
words hold out makes me strong again. Come, come, take my life;
take all that I can give. Give me him."</p>
<p>"Do you believe that I am an ogress thirsting for blood,
Dorothy, that you offer me your life for his? You can purchase Sir
John's life at a much smaller cost." Dorothy rose to the queen with
a cry, and put her arms about her neck. "You may purchase his
freedom," continued the queen, "and you may serve your loving queen
at one and the same time, if you wish to do so."</p>
<p>Dorothy had sunk back into the bed, and Elizabeth was sitting
close by her side; but when the queen spoke she turned her head on
the pillow and kissed the royal hand which was resting upon the
coverlid.</p>
<p>"Ah, you are so good, so true, and so beautiful," said
Dorothy.</p>
<p>Her familiarity toward the queen was sweet to the woman, to whom
it was new.</p>
<p>Dorothy did not thank the queen for her graciousness. She did
not reply directly to her offer. She simply said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"John has told me many times that he was first attracted to me
because I resembled you."</p>
<p>The girl had ample faith in her own beauty, and knew full well
the subtle flattery which lay in her words. "He <a name="Page_342"
id="Page_342"></a>said," she continued, "that my hair in some faint
degree resembled yours, but he said it was not of so beautiful a
hue. I have loved my hair ever since the day he told me that it
resembled your Majesty's." The girl leaned forward toward the queen
and gently kissed the royal locks. They no more resembled Dorothy's
hair than brick dust resembles the sheen of gold.</p>
<p>The queen glanced at the reflection of her hair in the mirror
and it flatly contradicted Dorothy. But the girl's words were
backed by Elizabeth's vanity, and the adroit flattery went
home.</p>
<p>"Ah, my child," exclaimed her Majesty softly, as she leaned
forward and kissed Dorothy's fair cheek.</p>
<p>Dorothy wept gently for a moment and familiarly rested her face
upon the queen's breast. Then she entwined her white arms about
Elizabeth's neck and turned her glorious eyes up to the queen's
face that her Majesty might behold their wondrous beauty and feel
the flattery of the words she was about to utter.</p>
<p>"He said also," continued Dorothy, "that my eyes in some slight
degree resembled your Majesty's, but he qualified his compliment by
telling me&mdash;he did not exactly tell me that my eyes were not
so large and brilliant as your Majesty's, for he was making love to
me, and of course he would not have dared to say that my eyes were
not the most perfect on earth; but he did say that&mdash;at least I
know that he meant&mdash;that my eyes, while they resembled yours,
were hardly so glorious, and&mdash;and I am very jealous of your
Majesty. John will be leaving me to worship at your feet."</p>
<p>Elizabeth's eyes were good enough. The French called them
"marcassin," that is, wild boar's eyes. They were little and
sparkling; they were not luminous and large like Dorothy's, and the
girl's flattery was rank. Elizabeth, however, saw Dorothy's eyes
and believed her words rather <a name="Page_343" id=
"Page_343"></a>than the reply of the lying mirror, and her
Majesty's heart was soft from the girl's kneading. Consider, I pray
you, the serpent-like wisdom displayed by Dorothy's method of
attack upon the queen. She did not ask for John's liberty. She did
not seek it. She sought only to place John softly on Elizabeth's
heart. Some natures absorb flattery as the desert sands absorb the
unfrequent rain, and Elizabeth&mdash;but I will speak no ill of
her. She is the greatest and the best sovereign England has ever
had. May God send to my beloved country others like her. She had
many small shortcomings; but I have noticed that those persons who
spend their evil energies in little faults have less force left for
greater ones. I will show you a mystery: Little faults are
personally more disagreeable and rasping to us than great ones.
Like flying grains of sand upon a windy day, they vex us
constantly. Great faults come like an avalanche, but they come less
frequently, and we often admire their possessor, who sooner or
later is apt to become our destroyer.</p>
<p>"I can hardly tell you," said Dorothy in response to a question
by Elizabeth, "I can hardly tell you why I informed your Majesty of
Queen Mary's presence at Rutland. I did it partly for love of your
Majesty and partly because I was jealous of that white, plain woman
from Scotland."</p>
<p>"She is not a plain woman, is she?" said Elizabeth, delighted to
hear Mary of Scotland so spoken of for once. One way to flatter
some women is to berate those whom they despise or fear. Elizabeth
loved Dorothy better for the hatred which the girl bore to Mary.
Both stood upon a broad plane of mutual sympathy-jealousy of the
same woman. It united the queen and the maiden in a common
heart-touching cause.</p>
<p>Dorothy's confidence grew apace. "She is plain," replied
Dorothy, poutingly. "She appears plain, colorless, and repulsive by
the side of your Majesty."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>No, no, Dorothy, that
cannot be," returned Queen Elizabeth, gently patting. Dorothy's
cheek and glancing stealthily at the reflection of her own face in
the mirror. At this point Dorothy considered that the time had come
for a direct attack.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty need have no fear of a plot to place Queen Mary
upon your throne. The English people would not endure her wicked
pale face for a moment."</p>
<p>"But there is such a plot in existence," said Elizabeth.</p>
<p>"What you say may be true," returned Dorothy; "but, your
Majesty, John is not in the plot, and he knows nothing of it."</p>
<p>"I hope&mdash;I believe&mdash;he is not in the plot," said
Elizabeth, "but I fear&mdash;"</p>
<p>The girl kissed the sleeve of Elizabeth's gown, and then she
drew the queen closer to her and kissed her hair and her face.</p>
<p>"Ah, my beauteous queen," said Dorothy, "I thank you for those
words. You must know that John loves you, and is your loyal
subject. Take pity upon me. Help me. Hold out your gracious hand
and lift me from my despair."</p>
<p>Dorothy slipped from the bed and fell on her knees, burying her
face in the queen's lap.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was touched by the girl's appeal, and caressingly
stroked her hair, as she said: "I believe he is innocent, but I
fear he knows or suspects others who harbor treasonable designs.
Tell me, Dorothy, do you know of any such persons? If you can tell
me their names, you will serve your queen, and will save your
lover. No harm shall come to Sir John, and no one save myself shall
have knowledge of any word that you may speak. If I do not learn
the names of the traitors through you or through Sir John, I may be
compelled to hold him a prisoner until I discover them. If through
you I learn them, Sir John shall go free at once."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a>Gladly, for your Majesty's
sake alone would I tell you the names of such traitorous men, did I
know them;" replied Dorothy, "and thrice gladly would I do so if I
might thereby liberate John. Your Majesty must see that these
motives are strong enough to induce me to speak if I knew aught to
tell you. I would betray the whole world to save him, of that you
may be sure. But alas! I know no man whom I can betray. John told
me nothing of his expedition to the Scottish border save what was
in two letters which he sent to me. One of these I received before
he left Rutland, and the other after his return."</p>
<p>She fetched the letters to the queen, who read them
carefully.</p>
<p>"Perhaps if I were to see him, he might, upon my importunity,
tell me all he knows concerning the affair and those connected with
it if he knows anything more than he has already told," said
Dorothy, by a great effort suppressing her eagerness. "I am sure,
your Majesty, he would tell me all Should he tell me the names of
any persons connected with any treasonable plot, I will certainly
tell you. It would be base in me again to betray John's confidence;
but your Majesty has promised me his life and liberty, and to
obtain those I would do anything, however evil it might be. If I
may see John, I promise to learn all that he knows, if he knows
anything; and I also promise to tell you word for word all that he
says."</p>
<p>The girl felt safe in making these promises, since she was sure
that John knew nothing of a treasonable character.</p>
<p>The queen, thinking that she had adroitly led Dorothy up to
making the offer, said, "I accept the conditions. Be in readiness
to visit Sir John, upon my command."</p>
<p>Thus the compact was sealed, and the queen, who thought herself
wise, was used by the girl, who thought herself simple.</p>
<p><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>For the purpose of hiding
her exultation, Dorothy appeared to be ill, but when the queen
passed out at the door and closed it behind her, the girl sprang
from the bed and danced around the room as if she were a
bear-baiter. From the depths of despair she flew to the pinnacle of
hope. She knew, however, that she must conceal her happiness;
therefore she went back to bed and waited impatiently the summons
of Elizabeth requiring her to go to John.</p>
<p>But now I must pause to tell you of my troubles which followed
so swiftly upon the heels of my fault that I was fairly stunned by
them. My narrative will be brief, and I shall soon bring you back
again to Dorothy.</p>
<p>Queen Mary had no sooner arrived at Haddon Hall than she opened
an attack upon Leicester, somewhat after the same plan, I suppose,
which she had followed with me in the coach. She could no more
easily resist inviting homage from men than a swallow can refrain
from flying. Thus, from inclination and policy, she sought
Leicester and endeavored by the pleasant paths of her blandishments
to lead him to her cause. There can be no doubt concerning
Leicester's wishes in the premises. Had Mary's cause held elements
of success, he would have joined her; but he feared Elizabeth, and
he hoped some day to share her throne. He would, however, prefer to
share the throne with Mary.</p>
<p>Mary told him of her plans and hopes. She told him that I had
ridden with Dorothy for the purpose of rescuing John and herself,
and that I had promised to help her to escape to France. She told
him she would use me for her tool in making her escape, and would
discard me when once she should be safe out of England. Then would
come Leicester's turn. Then should my lord have his recompense, and
together they would regain the Scottish crown.</p>
<p><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>How deeply Leicester became
engaged in the plot I cannot say, but this I know: through fear of
Elizabeth, or for the purpose of winning her favor, he unfolded to
our queen all the details of Mary's scheme, together with the full
story of my ride with Dorothy to Rutland, and my return with
Dorothy and Mary in the coach. Thereupon Mary was placed under
strict guard. The story spread quickly through the Hall, and Dawson
brought it to me. On hearing it, my first thought was of Madge. I
knew it would soon reach her. Therefore I determined to go to her
at once and make a clean breast of all my perfidy. Had I done so
sooner, I should at least have had the benefit of an honest,
voluntary confession; but my conscience had made a coward of me,
and the woman who had been my curse for years had so completely
disturbed my mind that I should have been quite as well off without
any at all. It led me from one mistake into another.</p>
<p>After Dawson told me that my miserable story was known
throughout the Hall, I sought Madge, and found her with Aunt
Dorothy. She was weeping, and I at once knew that I was too late
with my confession. I spoke her name, "Madge," and stood by her
side awaiting her reply.</p>
<p>"Is it true, Malcolm?" she asked. "I cannot believe it till I
hear it from your lips."</p>
<p>"It was true," I responded. "I promised to help Queen Mary
escape, and I promised to go with her; but within one hour of the
time when I gave my word I regretted it as I have never regretted
anything else in all my life. I resolved that, while I should,
according to my promise, help the Scottish queen escape, I would
not go with her. I resolved to wait here at Haddon to tell all to
you and to our queen, and then I would patiently take my just
punishment from each. My doom from the queen, I believed, would
probably be death; but I feared more your&mdash;God help me! It is
useless for me to speak." Here I broke <a name="Page_348" id=
"Page_348"></a>down and fell upon my knees, crying, "Madge, Madge,
pity me, pity me! Forgive me if you can, and, if our queen decrees
it, I shall die happy."</p>
<p>In my desperation I caught the girl's hand, but she drew it
quickly from me, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Do not touch me!"</p>
<p>She arose to her feet, and groped her way to her bedroom. We
were in Aunt Dorothy's room. I watched Madge as she sought with her
outstretched hand the doorway; and when she passed slowly through
it, the sun of my life seemed to turn black. Just as Madge passed
from the room, Sir William St. Loe, with two yeomen, entered by Sir
George's door and placed irons upon my wrist and ankles. I was led
by Sir William to the dungeon, and no word was spoken by either of
us.</p>
<p>I had never in my life feared death, and now I felt that I would
welcome it. When a man is convinced that his life is useless,
through the dire disaster that he is a fool, he values it little,
and is even more than willing to lose it.</p>
<p>Then there were three of us in the dungeon,&mdash;John, Lord
Rutland, and myself; and we were all there because we had meddled
in the affairs of others, and because Dorothy had inherited from
Eve a capacity for insane, unreasoning jealousy.</p>
<p>Lord Rutland was sitting on the ground in a corner of the
dungeon. John, by the help of a projecting stone in the masonry,
had climbed to the small grated opening which served to admit a few
straggling rays of light into the dungeon's gloom. He was gazing
out upon the fair day, whose beauty he feared would soon fade away
from him forever.</p>
<p>Elizabeth's coldness had given him no hope. It had taken all
hope from his father.</p>
<p>The opening of the door attracted John's attention, and he
turned his face toward me when I entered. He had <a name="Page_349"
id="Page_349"></a>been looking toward the light, and his eyes,
unaccustomed for the moment to the darkness, failed at first to
recognize of me. When the dungeon door had closed behind me, he
sprang down from his perch by the window, and came toward me with
outstretched hands. He said sorrowfully:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Malcolm, have I brought you here, too? Why are you in irons? It
seems that I am destined to bring calamity upon all whom I
love."</p>
<p>"It is a long story," I replied laughingly. "I will tell it to
you when the time begins to drag; but I tell you now it is through
no fault of yours that I am here. No one is to blame for my
misfortune but myself." Then I continued bitterly, "Unless it be
the good God who created me a fool."</p>
<p>John went to his father's side and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sir Malcolm is here, father. Will you not rise and greet
him?"</p>
<p>John's voice aroused his father, and the old lord came to the
little patch of light in which I was standing and said: "A terrible
evil has fallen upon us, Sir Malcolm, and without our fault. I
grieve to learn that you also are entangled in the web. The future
looks very dark."</p>
<p>"Cheer up, father," said John, taking the old man's hand. "Light
will soon come; I am sure it will."</p>
<p>"I have tried all my life to be a just man," said Lord Rutland.
"I have failed at times, I fear, but I have tried. That is all any
man can do. I pray that God in His mercy will soon send light to
you, John, whatever of darkness there may be in store for me."</p>
<p>I thought, "He will surely answer this just man's prayer," and
almost before the thought was completed the dungeon door turned
upon its hinges and a great light came with glorious refulgence
through the open portal&mdash;Dorothy.</p>
<p>"John!"</p>
<p>Never before did one word express so much of mingled <a name=
"Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>joy and grief. Fear and confidence,
and, greater than all, love unutterable were blended in its
eloquent tones. She sprang to John as the lightning leaps from
cloud to cloud, and he caught her to his heart. He gently kissed
her hair, her face being hidden in the folds of his doublet.</p>
<p>"Let me kneel, John, let me kneel," she murmured.</p>
<p>"No, Dorothy, no," he responded, holding her closely in his
arms.</p>
<p>"But one moment, John," she pleased.</p>
<p>"No, no; let me see your eyes, sweet one," said John, trying to
turn her face upward toward his own.</p>
<p>"I cannot yet, John, I cannot. Please let me kneel for one
little moment at your feet."</p>
<p>John saw that the girl would find relief in self-abasement, so
he relaxed his arms, and she sank to her knees upon the dungeon
floor. She wept softly for a moment, and then throwing back her
head with her old impulsive manner looked up into his face.</p>
<p>"Oh, forgive me, John! Forgive me! Not that I deserve your
forgiveness, but because you pity me."</p>
<p>"I forgave you long ago, Dorothy. You had my full forgiveness
before you asked it."</p>
<p>He lifted the weeping girl to her feet and the two clung
together in silence. After a pause Dorothy spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You have not asked me, John, why I betrayed you."</p>
<p>"I want to know nothing, Dorothy, save that you love me."</p>
<p>"That you already know. But you cannot know how much I love you.
I myself don't know. John, I seem to have turned all to love.
'However much there is of me, that much there is of love for you.
As the salt is in every drop of the sea, so love is in every part
of my being; but John," she continued, drooping her head and
speaking regretfully, "the salt in the sea is not unmixed with many
<a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>things hurtful." Her face
blushed with shame and she continued limpingly: "And my love is
not&mdash;is not without evil. Oh, John, I feel deep shame in
telling you, but my love is terribly jealous. At times a jealousy
comes over me so fierce and so distracting that under its influence
I am mad, John, mad. I then see nothing in its true light; my eyes
seem filled with&mdash;with blood, and all things appear red or
black and&mdash;and&mdash;oh! John, I pray you never again cause me
jealousy. It makes a demon of me."</p>
<p>You may well know that John was nonplussed.</p>
<p>"I cause you jealousy?" he asked in surprise. "When did
I&mdash;" But Dorothy interrupted him, her eyes flashing darkly and
a note of fierceness in her voice. He saw for himself the effects
of jealousy upon her.</p>
<p>"That white&mdash;white Scottish wanton! God's curse be upon
her! She tried to steal you from me."</p>
<p>"Perhaps she did," replied John, smilingly, "of that I do not
know. But this I do know, and you, Dorothy, must know it too
henceforth and for all time to come. No woman can steal my love
from you. Since I gave you my troth I have been true to you; I have
not been false even in one little thought."</p>
<p>"I feel sure, John, that you have not been untrue to me," said
the girl with a faint smile playing about her lips; "but&mdash;but
you remember the strange woman at Bowling Green Gate whom you would
have&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Dorothy, I hope you have not come to my dungeon for the purpose
of making me more wretched than I already am?"</p>
<p>"No, no, John, forgive me," she cried softly; "but John, I hate
her, I hate her! and I want you to promise that you too will hate
her."</p>
<p>"I promise," said John, "though, you have had no cause for
jealousy of Queen Mary."</p>
<p>"Perhaps&mdash;not," she replied hesitatingly. "I have <a name=
"Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>never thought," the girl continued
poutingly, "that you did anything of which I should be jealous; but
she&mdash;she&mdash;oh, I hate her! Let us not talk about her.
Jennie Faxton told me&mdash;I will talk about her, and you shall
not stop me&mdash;Jennie Faxton told me that the white woman made
love to you and caused you to put your arm about her waist one
evening on the battlements and-"</p>
<p>"Jennie told you a lie," said John.</p>
<p>"Now don't interrupt me," the girl cried nervously, almost ready
for tears, "and I will try to tell you all. Jennie told me
the&mdash;the white woman looked up to you this fashion," and the
languishing look she gave John in imitation of Queen Mary was so
beautiful and comical that he could do nothing but laugh and cover
her face with kisses, then laugh again and love the girl more
deeply and yet more deeply with each new breath he drew. Dorothy
was not sure whether she wanted to laugh or to cry, so she did
both.</p>
<p>"Jennie told me in the middle of the night," continued Dorothy,
"when all things seem so vivid and appear so distorted
and&mdash;and that terrible blinding jealousy of which I told you
came upon me and drove me mad. I really thought, John, that I
should die of the agony. Oh, John, if you could know the anguish I
suffered that night you would pity me; you would not blame me."</p>
<p>"I do not blame you, Dorothy."</p>
<p>"No, no, there-" she kissed him softly, and quickly continued:
"I felt that I must separate her from you at all cost. I would have
done murder to accomplish my purpose. Some demon whispered to me,
'Tell Queen Elizabeth,' and&mdash;and oh, John, let me kneel
again."</p>
<p>"No, no, Dorothy, let us talk of something else," said John,
soothingly.</p>
<p>"In one moment, John. I thought only of the evil that would come
to her&mdash;her of Scotland. I did not think of <a name="Page_353"
id="Page_353"></a>the trouble I would bring to you, John, until the
queen, after asking me if you were my lover, said angrily: 'You may
soon seek another.' Then, John, I knew that I had also brought evil
upon you. Then I <i>did</i> suffer. I tried to reach Rutland, and
you know all else that happened on that terrible night. Now John,
you know all&mdash;all. I have withheld nothing. I have, confessed
all, and I feel that a great weight is taken from my heart. You
will not hate me, will you, John?"</p>
<p>He caught the girl to his breast and tried to turn her face
toward his.</p>
<p>"I could not hate you if I would," he replied, with quick-coming
breath, "and God knows I would not. To love you is the sweetest joy
in life," and he softly kissed the great lustrous eyes till they
closed as if in sleep. Then he fiercely sought the rich red lips,
waiting soft and passive for his caresses, while the fair head fell
back upon the bend of his elbow in a languorous, half-conscious
sweet surrender to his will. Lord Rutland and I had turned our
backs on the shameless pair, and were busily discussing the
prospect for the coming season's crops.</p>
<p>Remember, please, that Dorothy spoke to John of Jennie Faxton.
Her doing so soon bore bitter fruit for me.</p>
<p>Dorothy had been too busy with John to notice any one else, but
he soon presented her to his father. After the old lord had
gallantly kissed her hand, she turned scornfully to me and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"So you fell a victim to her wanton wiles? If it were not for
Madge's sake, I could wish you might hang."</p>
<p>"You need not balk your kindly desire for Madge's sake," I
answered. "She cares little about my fate. I fear she will never
forgive me."</p>
<p>"One cannot tell what a woman will do," Dorothy replied. "She is
apt to make a great fool of herself when it comes to forgiving the
man she loves."</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a>Men at times have
something to forgive," I retorted, looking with a smile toward
John. The girl made no reply, but took John's hand and looked at
him as if to say, "John, please don't let this horrid man abuse
me."</p>
<p>"But Madge no longer cares for me," I continued, wishing to talk
upon the theme, "and your words do not apply to her."</p>
<p>The girl turned her back disdainfully on me and said, "You seem
to be quite as easily duped by the woman who loves you and says she
doesn't as by the one who does not care for you but says she
does."</p>
<p>"Damn that girl's tongue!" thought I; but her words, though
biting, carried joy to my heart and light to my soul.</p>
<p>After exchanging a few words with Lord Rutland, Dorothy turned
to John and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Tell me upon your knightly honor, John, do you know aught of a
wicked, treasonable plot to put the Scottish woman on the English
throne?"</p>
<p>I quickly placed my finger on my lips and touched my ear to
indicate that their words would be overheard; for a listening-tube
connected the dungeon with Sir George's closet.</p>
<p>"Before the holy God, upon my knighthood, by the sacred love we
bear each other, I swear I know of no such plot," answered John. "I
would be the first to tell our good queen did I suspect its
existence."</p>
<p>Dorothy and John continued talking upon the subject of the plot,
but were soon interrupted by a warning knock upon the dungeon
door.</p>
<p>Lord Rutland, whose heart was like twenty-two carat gold, soft,
pure, and precious, kissed Dorothy's hand when she was about to
leave, and said: "Dear lady, grieve not for our sake. I can easily
see that more pain has come to you than to us. I thank you for the
great fearless love <a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a>you bear
my son. It has brought him trouble, but it is worth its cost. You
have my forgiveness freely, and I pray God's choicest benediction
may be with you." She kissed the old lord and said, "I hope some
day to make you love me."</p>
<p>"That will be an easy task," said his Lordship, gallantly.
Dorothy was about to leave. Just at the doorway she remembered the
chief purpose of her visit; so she ran back to John, put her hand
over his mouth to insure silence, and whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>On hearing Dorothy's whispered words, signs of joy were so
apparent in John's face that they could not be mistaken. He said
nothing, but kissed her hand and she hurriedly left the
dungeon.</p>
<p>After the dungeon door closed upon Dorothy, John went to his
father and whispered a few words to him. Then he came to me, and in
the same secretive manner said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The queen has promised Dorothy our liberty." I was not at all
sure that "our liberty" included me,&mdash;I greatly doubted
it,&mdash;but I was glad for the sake of my friends, and, in truth,
cared little for myself.</p>
<p>Dorothy went from our dungeon to the queen, and that afternoon,
according to promise, Elizabeth gave orders for the release of John
and his father. Sir George, of course, was greatly chagrined when
his enemies slipped from his grasp; but he dared not show his ill
humor in the presence of the queen nor to any one who would be apt
to enlighten her Majesty on the subject.</p>
<p>Dorothy did not know the hour when her lover would leave Haddon;
but she sat patiently at her window till at last John and Lord
Rutland appeared. She called to Madge, telling her of the joyous
event, and Madge, asked:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Is Malcolm with them?"</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>No," replied Dorothy, "he
has been left in the dungeon, where he deserves to remain."</p>
<p>After a short pause, Madge said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If John had acted toward the Scottish queen as Malcolm did,
would you forgive him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course. I would forgive him anything."</p>
<p>"Then why shall we not forgive Malcolm?" asked Madge.</p>
<p>"Because he is not John," was the absurd reply.</p>
<p>"No," said Madge, promptly; "but he is 'John' to me."</p>
<p>"That is true," responded Dorothy, "and I will forgive him if
you will."</p>
<p>"I don't believe it makes much difference to Malcolm whether or
not you forgive him," said Madge, who was provoked at Dorothy's
condescending offer. "My forgiveness, I hope, is what he
desires."</p>
<p>"That is true, Madge," replied Dorothy, laughingly; "but may not
I, also, forgive him?"</p>
<p>"If you choose," responded Madge, quietly; "as for me, I know
not what I wish to do."</p>
<p>You remember that Dorothy during her visit to the dungeon spoke
of Jennie Faxton. The girl's name reached Sir George's ear through
the listening-tube and she was at once brought in and put to the
question.</p>
<p>Jennie, contrary to her wont, became frightened and told all she
knew concerning John and Dorothy, including my part in their
affairs. In Sir George's mind, my bad faith to him was a greater
crime than my treason to Elizabeth, and he at once went to the
queen with his tale of woe.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, the most sentimental of women, had heard from Dorothy
the story of her tempestuous love, and also of mine, and the queen
was greatly interested in the situation.</p>
<p>I will try to be brief.</p>
<p><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>Through the influence of
Dorothy and Madge, as I afterward learned, and by the help of a
good word from Cecil, the queen was induced to order my liberation
on condition that I should thenceforth reside in France. So one
morning, three days after John's departure from Haddon, I was
overjoyed to hear the words, "You are free."</p>
<p>I did not know that Jennie Faxton had given Sir George her large
stock of disturbing information concerning my connection with the
affairs of Dorothy and John. So when I left the dungeon, I,
supposing that my stormy cousin would be glad to forgive me if
Queen Elizabeth would, sought and found him in Aunt Dorothy's room.
Lady Crawford and Sir George were sitting near the fire and Madge
was standing near the door in the next room beyond. When I entered,
Sir George sprang to his feet and cried out angrily:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You traitorous dog, the queen has seen fit to liberate you, and
I cannot interfere with her orders; but if you do not leave my Hall
at once I shall set the hounds on you. Your effects will be sent to
The Peacock, and the sooner you quit England the safer you will
be." There was of course nothing for me to do but to go.</p>
<p>"You once told me, Sir George&mdash;you remember our interview
at The Peacock&mdash;that if you should ever again order me to
leave Haddon, I should tell you to go to the devil. I now take
advantage of your kind permission, and will also say farewell."</p>
<p>I kissed Aunt Dorothy's cheek, took my leave, and sought Cecil,
from whom I obtained a passport to France. Then I asked Dawson to
fetch my horse.</p>
<p>I longed to see Madge before I left Haddon, but I knew that my
desire could not be gratified; so I determined to stop at Rowsley
and send back a letter to her which Dawson undertook to deliver. In
my letter I would ask Madge's permission to return for her from
France <a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a>and to take her home
with me as my wife. After I had despatched my letter I would wait
at The Peacock for an answer.</p>
<p>Sore at heart, I bade good-by to Dawson, mounted my horse, and
turned his head toward the Dove-cote Gate. As I rode under
Dorothy's window she was sitting there. The casement was open, for
the day was mild, although the season was little past midwinter. I
heard her call to Madge, and then she called to me:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Farewell, Malcolm! Forgive me for what I said to you in the
dungeon. I was wrong, as usual. Forgive me, and God bless you.
Farewell!"</p>
<p>While Dorothy was speaking, and before I replied, Madge came to
the open casement and called:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Wait for me, Malcolm, I am going down to you."</p>
<p>Great joy is a wonderful purifier, and Madge's cry finished the
work of the past few months and made a good man of me, who all my
life before had known little else than evil.</p>
<p>Soon Madge's horse was led by a groom to the mounting block, and
in a few minutes she emerged gropingly from the great door of
Entrance Tower. Dorothy was again a prisoner in her rooms and could
not come down to bid me farewell. Madge mounted, and the groom led
her horse to me and placed the reins in my hands.</p>
<p>"Is it you, Malcolm?" asked Madge.</p>
<p>"Yes," I responded, in a voice husky with emotion. "I cannot
thank you enough for coming to say farewell. You have forgiven
me?"</p>
<p>"Yes," responded Madge, almost in tears, "but I have not come to
say farewell."</p>
<p>I did not understand her meaning.</p>
<p>"Are you going to ride part of the way with me&mdash;perhaps to
Rowsley?" I asked, hardly daring to hope for so much.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>To France, Malcolm, if you
wish to take me," she responded murmuringly.</p>
<p>For a little time I could not feel the happiness that had come
upon me in so great a flood. But when I had collected my scattered
senses, I said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I thank God that He has turned your heart again to me. May I
feel His righteous anger if ever I give you cause to regret the
step you are taking."</p>
<p>"I shall never regret it, Malcolm," she answered softly, as she
held out her hand to me.</p>
<p>Then we rode by the dove-cote, out from Haddon Hall, never to
see its walls again.</p>
<p>We went to Rutland, whence after a fortnight we journeyed to
France. There I received my mother's estates, and never for one
moment, to my knowledge, has Madge regretted having intrusted her
life and happiness to me. I need not speak for myself.</p>
<p>Our home is among the warm, sunlit, vine-covered hills of
southern France, and we care not for the joys of golden streets so
long as God in His goodness vouchsafes to us our earthly paradise.
Age, with the heart at peace, is the fairest season of life; and
love, leavened of God, robs even approaching death of his sting and
makes for us a broad flower-strewn path from the tempestuous sea of
time to the calm, sweet ocean of eternity.</p>

id="Page_360"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h2>LEICESTER WAITS AT THE STILE</h2>
<p>I shall now tell you of the happenings in Haddon Hall during the
fortnight we spent at Rutland before our departure for France.</p>
<p>We left Dorothy, you will remember, a prisoner in her rooms.</p>
<p>After John had gone Sir George's wrath began to gather, and
Dorothy was not permitted to depart from the Hall for even a walk
upon the terrace, nor could she leave her own apartments save when
the queen requested her presence.</p>
<p>A few days after my departure from Haddon, Sir George sent
Dawson out through the adjoining country to invite the nobility and
gentry to a grand ball to be given at the Hall in honor of Queen
Elizabeth. Queen Mary had been sent a prisoner to Chatsworth.</p>
<p>Tom Shaw, the most famous piper of his times, and a choice
company of musicians to play with him were hired for the occasion,
and, in short, the event was so glorious that its wonders have been
sung in minstrelsy throughout Derbyshire ever since.</p>
<p>Dorothy's imprisonment saddened Leicester's heart, and he longed
to see her, for her beauty had touched him nearly. Accordingly, the
earl one day intimated to Sir George his wish in terms that almost
bespoke an intention to ask for the girl's hand when upon proper
oppor<a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a>tunity the queen's
consent might be sought and perchance obtained. His equivocal words
did not induce Sir George to grant a meeting by which Dorothy might
be compromised; but a robust hope for the ultimate accomplishment
of the "Leicester possibility" was aroused in the breast of the
King of the Peak, and from hope he could, and soon did, easily step
to faith. He saw that the earl was a handsome man, and he believed,
at least he hoped, that the fascinating lord might, if he were
given an opportunity, woo Dorothy's heart away from the hated scion
of a hated race. Sir George, therefore, after several interviews
with the earl, grew anxious to give his Lordship an opportunity to
win her. But both Sir George and my lord feared Elizabeth's
displeasure, and the meeting between Leicester and the girl seemed
difficult to contrive. Sir George felt confident that Dorothy
could, if she would, easily capture the great lord in a few private
interviews; but would she? Dorothy gave her father no encouragement
in the matter, and took pains to shun Leicester rather than to seek
him.</p>
<p>As Dorothy grew unwilling, Leicester and Sir George grew eager,
until at length the latter felt that it was almost time to exert
his parental authority. He told Aunt Dorothy his feeling on the
subject, and she told her niece. It was impossible to know from
what source Dorothy might draw inspiration for mischief. It came to
her with her father's half-command regarding Leicester.</p>
<p>Winter had again asserted itself. The weather was bitter cold
and snow covered the ground to the depth of a horse's fetlock.</p>
<p>The eventful night of the grand ball arrived, and Dorothy's
heart throbbed till she thought surely it would burst.</p>
<p>At nightfall guests began to arrive, and Sir George, hospitable
soul that he was, grew boisterous with good humor and delight.</p>
<p>The rare old battlements of Haddon were ablaze with <a name=
"Page_362" id="Page_362"></a>flambeaux, and inside the rooms were
alight with waxen tapers. The long gallery was brilliant with the
smiles of bejewelled beauty, and laughter, song, and merriment
filled the grand old Hall from terrace to Entrance Tower. Dorothy,
of course, was brought down from her prison to grace the occasion
with a beauty which none could rival. Her garments were of soft,
clinging, bright-colored silks and snowy laces, and all who saw her
agreed that a creature more radiant never greeted the eye of
man.</p>
<p>When the guests had all arrived, the pipers in the balcony burst
forth in heart-swelling strains of music, and every foot in the
room longed for the dance to begin.</p>
<p>I should like to tell you how Elizabeth most graciously opened
the ball with his Majesty, the King of the Peak, amid the plaudits
of worshipping subjects, and I should enjoy describing the riotous
glory which followed,&mdash;for although I was not there, I know
intimately all that happened,&mdash;but I will balk my desire and
tell you only of those things which touched Dorothy.</p>
<p>Leicester, of course, danced with her, and during a pause in the
figure, the girl in response to pleadings which she had adroitly
incited, reluctantly promised to grant the earl the private
interview he so much desired if he could suggest some means for
bringing it about. Leicester was in raptures over her complaisance
and glowed with triumph and delightful anticipation. But he could
think of no satisfactory plan whereby his hopes might be brought to
a happy fruition. He proposed several, but all seemed impracticable
to the coy girl, and she rejected them. After many futile attempts
he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I can suggest no good plan, mistress. I pray you, gracious
lady, therefore, make full to overflowing the measure of your
generosity, and tell me how it may be accomplished."</p>
<p>Dorothy hung her head as if in great shame and said:<a name=
"Page_363" id="Page_363"></a> "I fear, my lord, we had better
abandon the project for a time. Upon another occasion
perhaps&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no," interrupted the earl, pleadingly, "do not so
grievously disappoint me. My heart yearns to have you to myself for
one little moment where spying eyes cannot see nor prying ears
hear. It is cruel in you to raise my hopes only to cast them down.
I beg you, tell me if you know in what manner I may meet you
privately."</p>
<p>After a long pause, Dorothy with downcast eyes said, "I am full
of shame, my lord, to consent to this meeting, and then find the
way to it, but&mdash;but&mdash;" ("Yes, yes, my Venus, my gracious
one," interrupted the earl)&mdash;"but if my father would permit me
to&mdash;to leave the Hall for a few minutes, I might&mdash;oh, it
is impossible, my lord. I must not think of it."</p>
<p>"I pray you, I beg you," pleaded Leicester. "Tell me, at least,
what you might do if your father would permit you to leave the
Hall. I would gladly fall to my knees, were it not for the
assembled company."</p>
<p>With reluctance in her manner and gladness in her heart, the
girl said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"If my father would permit me to leave the Hall, I
might&mdash;only for a moment, meet you at the stile, in the
northeast corner of the garden back of the terrace half an hour
hence. But he would not permit me, and&mdash;and, my lord, I ought
not to go even should father consent."</p>
<p>"I will ask your father's permission for you. I will seek him at
once," said the eager earl.</p>
<p>"No, no, my lord, I pray you, do not," murmured Dorothy, with
distracting little troubled wrinkles in her forehead. Her trouble
was more for fear lest he would not than for dread that he
would.</p>
<p>"I will, I will," cried his Lordship, softly; "I insist, and you
shall not gainsay me."</p>
<p>The girl's only assent was silence, but that was sufficient
<a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a>for so enterprising a gallant
as the noble Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. So he at once went
to seek Sir George.</p>
<p>The old gentleman, although anxious to give Leicester a chance
to press his suit with Dorothy, at first refused, but Leicester
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"My intentions are honorable, Sir George. If I can win your
daughter's heart, it is my wish, if the queen's consent can be
obtained, to ask Mistress Vernon's hand in marriage."</p>
<p>Sir George's breast swelled with pride and satisfaction, for
Leicester's words were as near an offer of marriage as it was in
his power to make. So the earl received, for Dorothy, permission to
leave the Hall, and eagerly carried it to her.</p>
<p>"Your father consents gladly," said the earl. "Will you meet me
half an hour hence at the stile?"</p>
<p>"Yes," murmured the girl, with shamelessly cast down eyes and
drooping head. Leicester bowed himself away, and fully fifteen
minutes before the appointed time left the Hall to wait in the cold
at the stile for Dorothy.</p>
<p>Before the expiration of the tedious half hour our meek maiden
went to her father and with deep modesty and affected shame
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Father, is it your wish that I go out of the Hall for a few
minutes to meet&mdash;to meet&mdash;" She apparently could not
finish the sentence, so modest and shame-faced was she.</p>
<p>"Yes, Doll, I wish you to go on this condition: if Leicester
asks you to marry him, you shall consent to be his wife."</p>
<p>"I promise, father," replied the dutiful girl, "if Lord
Leicester asks me this night, I will be his wife."</p>
<p>"That is well, child, that is well. Once more you are my good,
obedient daughter, and I love you. Wear your sable cloak, Doll; the
weather is very cold out of doors."</p>
<p>Her father's solicitude touched her nearly, and she <a name=
"Page_365" id="Page_365"></a>gently led him to a secluded alcove
near by, threw her arms about his neck, and kissed him
passionately. The girl's affection was sweet to the old man who had
been without it so long, and his eyes grew moist as he returned her
caresses. Dorothy's eyes also were filled with tears. Her throat
was choked with sobs, and her heart was sore with pain. Poor young
heart! Poor old man!</p>
<p>Soon after Dorothy had spoken with her father she left the Hall
by Dorothy's Postern. She was wrapped in her sable cloak&mdash;the
one that had saved John's life in Aunt Dorothy's room; but instead
of going across the garden to the stile where Lord Leicester was
waiting, which was north and east of the terrace, she sped
southward down the terrace and did not stop till she reached the
steps which led westward to the lower garden. She stood on the
terrace till she saw a man running toward her from the postern in
the southwest corner of the lower garden. Then down the steps she
sped with winged feet, and outstretching her arms, fell upon the
man's breast, whispering: "John, my love! John, my love!"</p>
<p>As for the man&mdash;well, during the first minute or two he
wasted no time in speech.</p>
<p>When he spoke he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We must not tarry here. Horses are waiting at the south end of
the footbridge. Let us hasten away at once."</p>
<p>Then happened the strangest of all the strange things I have had
to record of this strange, fierce, tender, and at time almost
half-savage girl.</p>
<p>Dorothy for months had longed for that moment. Her heart had
almost burst with joy when a new-born hope for it was suggested by
the opportunities of the ball and her father's desire touching my
lord of Leicester. But now that the longed-for moment was at hand,
the tender heart, which had so anxiously awaited it, failed, and
the girl broke down weeping hysterically.</p>
<p>"<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a>Oh, John, you have
forgiven so many faults in me," she said between sobs, "that I know
you will forgive me when I tell you I cannot go with you to-night.
I thought I could and I so intended when I came out here to meet
you. But oh, John, my dearest love, I cannot go; I cannot go.
Another time I will go with you, John. I promise that I will go
with you soon, very soon, John; but I cannot go now, oh, I cannot.
You will forgive me, won't you, John? You will forgive me?"</p>
<p>"No," cried John in no uncertain tones, "I will not forgive you.
I will take you. If you cry out, I will silence you." Thereupon he
rudely took the girl in his arms and ran with her toward the garden
gate near the north end of the stone footbridge.</p>
<p>"John, John!" she cried in terror. But he placed his hand over
her mouth and forced her to remain silent till they were past the
south wall. Then he removed his hand and she screamed and struggled
against him with all her might. Strong as she was, her strength was
no match for John's, and her struggles were in vain.</p>
<p>John, with his stolen bride, hurriedly crossed the footbridge
and ran to the men who were holding the horses. There he placed
Dorothy on her feet and said with a touch of anger:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Will you mount of your own will or shall I put you in the
saddle?"</p>
<p>"I'll mount of my own will, John," she replied submissively,
"and John, I&mdash;I thank you, I thank you for&mdash;for&mdash;"
she stopped speaking and toyed with the tufts of fur that hung from
the edges of her cloak.</p>
<p>"For what, my love? For what do you thank me?" asked John after
a little pause.</p>
<p>"For making&mdash;me&mdash;do&mdash;what I&mdash;I longed to do.
My conscience would not let me do it of my own free will."</p>
<p><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a>Then tears came from her
eyes in a great flood, and throwing her arms about John's neck she
gave him herself and her heart to keep forever and forever.</p>
<p>And Leicester was shivering at the stile! The girl had forgotten
even the existence of the greatest lord in the realm.</p>
<p>My wife, Lord Rutland, and I waited in the watch-room above the
castle gates for the coming of Dorothy and John; and when they
came&mdash;but I will not try to describe the scene. It were a vain
effort. Tears and laughter well compounded make the sweetest joy;
grief and joy the truest happiness; happiness and pain the grandest
soul, and none of these may be described. We may analyze them, and
may take them part from part; but, like love, they cannot be
compounded. We may know all the component parts, but when we try to
create these great emotions in description, we lack the subtle
compounding flux to unite the ingredients, and after all is done,
we have simply said that black is black and that white is
white.</p>
<p>Next day, in the morning, Madge and I started for our new home
in France. We rode up the hill down which poor Dolcy took her last
fatal plunge, and when we reached the crest, we paused to look
back. Standing on the battlements, waving a kerchief in farewell to
us, was the golden-crowned form of a girl. Soon she covered her
face with her kerchief, and we knew she was weeping Then we, also,
wept as we turned away from the fair picture; and since that
far-off morning&mdash;forty long, long years ago&mdash;we have not
seen the face nor heard the voice of our sweet, tender friend.
Forty years! What an eternity it is if we tear it into minutes!</p>

<p>The fire ceases to burn; the flames are sucked back into the
earth; the doe's blood has boiled away; the caldron cools, and my
shadowy friends&mdash;so real to me&mdash;whom I love with a
passionate tenderness beyond my power to express, have sunk into
the dread black bank of the past, and my poor, weak wand is
powerless to recall them for the space of even one fleeting moment.
So I must say farewell to them; but all my life I shall carry a
heart full of tender love and pain for the fairest, fiercest,
gentlest, weakest, strongest of them all&mdash;Dorothy Vernon.</p>

<p>Malcolm Vernon is the only writer on the life of Dorothy Vernon
who speaks of Rutland Castle. All others writing on the subject say
that Belvoir Castle was the home of the Earl of Rutland.</p>
<p>No other writer mentions the proposed marriage, spoken of by
Malcolm, between Dorothy and Lord Derby's son. They do, however,
say that Dorothy had an elder sister who married a Stanley, but
died childless, leaving Dorothy sole heiress to Sir George Vernon's
vast estate.</p>
<p>All writers agree with Malcolm upon the main fact that brave
Dorothy eloped with John Manners and brought to him the fair estate
of Haddon, which their descendant, the present Duke of Rutland, now
possesses.</p>
<p>No other writer speaks of Mary Stuart having been at Haddon, and
many chroniclers disagree with Malcolm as to the exact date of her
imprisonment in Lochleven and her escape.</p>
<p>In all other essential respects the history of Dorothy Vernon as
told by Malcolm agrees with other accounts of her life.</p>
<p>I do not pretend to reconcile the differences between these
great historical authorities, but I confess to considerable faith
in Malcolm.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
